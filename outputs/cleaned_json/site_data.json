          "Megha- Tropiques (MT) is a joint Indo-French collaborative satellite mission, which is launched on 12 October 2011. The main objective of MT is to get more understanding on convective system, energy exchange and water cycle in the tropical region. It is equipped with Microwave Analysis and Detection of Rain and Atmospheric Structures (MADRAS) (not in operational), Scanner for Radiation Budget and Radio Occultation Sensor for Atmosphere and  Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d’Humidite Intertropical par Radiometrie (SAPHIR). SAPHIR provides clear sky atmospheric humidity profiles at 6-channels near 183.31GHz water vapour resonance. The observations of SAPHIR  provides an opportunity to estimate rainfall using 183.31GHz channels.  A Bayesian based rainfall retrieval technique is developed using SAPHIR channel-6 (183.31±11GHz) brightness temperature observations. Estimated rainfall has been validated with IMERG and DPR products during Jan-Dec 2017. The global distribution of rainfall patterns are captured well by the estimation."

The radar reflectivity has been corrected for clutter using a combination of a spatial continuity filter and a fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm. The velocity folded regions are dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing algorithm. The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity are then gridded into 1 km x 1 km x 250 m 3D volumetric grid which can be used by scientists for further meteorological applications.

          "Lagrangian technique is used for generating high-resolution sea surface salinity fields in the Bay of Bengal. This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically."

          "SARAL, a joint ISRO-CNES satellite mission, was successfully launched in 2013. It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product."

    "mission_details": "SARAL-AltiKa\nSARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc\nहिन्दी",

    "mission_details": "INSAT-3DR Payloads\nT\nhe satellite has 3 payloads:\nMeteorological (MET) - IMAGER and SOUNDER\nData Relay Transponder (DRT)\nSatellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R)\nMeteorological Payload\nThe INSAT-3DR spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments.\nIMAGER\nThe INSAT-3DR imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band.\nT\nhe Imager is an improved design of VHRR-2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution.\nThis new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors. The INSAT-3DR Imager payload is a replica of INSAT-3D Imager.\nKey Parameters of the Imager\nTelescope aperture\n310 mm diameter\nNumber of bands (6)\n0.52 - 0.72 µm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 µm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 µm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 µm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 µm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 µm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared)\nSpatial resolution\n1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2\nBand separation, band definition\nBeam splitter, interference filters\nIFOV (Instantaneous Field of View)\n28 µrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 µrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 µrad for WV (8 km)\nSampling interval\n1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV\nScan step angle\nLinear in E-W direction (8 µR step size)\nLine step 224 µrad in N-S direction\nScan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration\n200º/s +0.2 s turnaround time\n56 µR (peak to peak)\nFull aperture blackbody and spaceview\nScan modes\nFull, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity\nFrame time\n25 minutes for normal mode\nSignal quantization\n10 bit/sample\nDownlink data rate\n4.0 Mbit/s\nSOUNDER\nThe INSAT-3DR sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands alongwith one visible band. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional maps of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere.\nT\nhe Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.

    "mission_details": "INSAT-3D Payloads\nT\nhe satellite has 3 payloads:\nMeteorological (MET) - IMAGER and SOUNDER\nData Relay Transponder (DRT)\nSatellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R)\nMeteorological Payload\nThe INSAT-3D spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments.\nIMAGER\nThe INSAT-3D imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band.\nT\nhe Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution.\nThis new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors.\nKey Parameters of the Imager\nTelescope aperture\n310 mm diameter\nNumber of bands (6)\n0.52 - 0.72 µm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 µm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 µm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 µm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 µm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 µm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared)\nSpatial resolution\n1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2\nBand separation, band definition\nBeam splitter, interference filters\nIFOV (Instantaneous Field of View)\n28 µrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 µrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 µrad for WV (8 km)\nSampling interval\n1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV\nScan step angle\nLinear in E-W direction (8 µR step size)\nLine step 224 µrad in N-S direction\nScan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration\n200º/s +0.2 s turnaround time\n56 µR (peak to peak)\nFull aperture blackbody and spaceview\nScan modes\nFull, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity\nFrame time\n25 minutes for normal mode\nSignal quantization\n10 bit/sample\nDownlink data rate\n4.0 Mbit/s\nSOUNDER\nThe INSAT-3D sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere.\nT\nhe Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.\nKey Parameters of the sounder\nTelescope aperture\n310 mm diameter\nNumber of bands (6)\n18 Infrared + 1 Visible\nBand definition\nFilter wheel with interference filters\nIFOV (Instantaneous Field of View)\n280 µrad x 280 rad, corresponding to 10 km x 10 km on the surface\nSampling interval\n280 µrad E-W / N-S\nNo of simultaneous soundings\n4 per band\nScan step angle\n10 km E-W, every 0.1 s, and 40 km N-S after completion of E-W scan, 150 µR rms\nStep and dwell time\n0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 s\nTurnaround time\n0.1 s per scan\nIn-flight calibration\nFull aperture blackbody and space view\nScan modes\nOptions provided to cater to quick dynamic environmental phenomena\nFrame time\n160 minutes for 6000 km x 6000 km area sounding\nSignal quantization\n13 bit/sample\nDownlink data rate\n40 kbit/s\nFrame time\n90 kg, (without cooler), 100 W\nSpectral parameters and sensitivity of the sounder\nBand No.\nCenter wavelength µm (cm-1)\nBandwidth µm (cm-1)\nNEDT at 300 K (typical) K\n1\n14.71 (680)\n0.281 (13)\n1.5\n2\n14.37 (696)\n0.268 (13)\n1\n3\n14.06 (711)\n0.256 (13)\n0.5\n4\n13.96 (733)\n0.298 (16)\n0.5\n5\n13.37 (749)\n0.286 (16)\n0.5\n6\n12.66 (790)\n0.481 (30)\n0.3\n7\n12.02 (832)\n0.723 (50)\n0.15\n8\n11.03 (907)\n0.608 (50)\n0.15\n9\n9.71 (1030)\n0.235 (25)\n0.2\n10\n7.43 (1425)\n0.304 (55)\n0.2\n11\n7.02 (1425)\n0.394 (80)\n0.2\n12\n6.51 (1535)\n0.255 (60)\n0.2\n13\n4.57 (2188)\n0.048 (23)\n0.2\n14\n4.52 (2210)\n0.047 (23)\n0.15\n15\n4.45 (2245)\n0.045 (23)\n0.15\n16\n4.13 (2420)\n0.0683 (40)\n0.15\n17\n3.98 (2513)\n0.0683 (40)\n0.15\n18\n3.74 (2671)\n0.140 (100)\n0.15\n19\n0.695 (14367) 0.05 (1000) (0.67-0.72)\n0.1% albedo\nCommunication Payload\nCommunication transponders are required to be configured to provide continuity of some of the INSAT services. A total satellite mass of 2000kg is considered for the launch compatibility, and 70 kg (approximately) of mass apportionment is done for the communication payload components. The communication payload components are - Meteorological Transmitter, Data Relay Transponder, Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Transponder & S-band Broadcast Satellite Services Transponder.",

MetSat has been designed using a new spacecraft bus (I-1000 bus) employing lightweight structural elements like CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic). A central structural thrust cylinder provides mounting interfaces propellant tanks, pressurant tank, equipment panels, payload, solar array assembly, and with the launch vehicle.\nStructural brackets are provided to mount momentum wheels, reaction wheel, RCS (Reaction Control System) thrusters, earth sensors, sun sensors, LAM (Liquid Apogee Motor), and propulsion components.\nMetSat-1 is three-axis stabilized (momentum biased control subsystem). However, unlike its INSAT predecessors, the MetSat-1 spacecraft does not feature a sail/boom design. The attitude is sensed by suite of sensors (gyros, Earth sensors, digital sun sensor, coarse analog sun sensors, and solar panel sun sensor). Magnetic torquers serve as actuators to unload the momentum of the wheels. In addition, active thrusters are used (one 440N LAM for orbit raising maneuvers and eight 22 N thrusters for orbit and attitude control).\nThe propulsion system employed is a unified bi-propellant with mono-methyl hydrazine (MMH) as fuel and mixed oxides of nitrogen (MON3) as oxidizer. The S/C employs passive thermal control system by utilizing multi-layer insulation blankets, optical solar reflectors, heat sinks, paints, thermal grease, thermal shields etc. The temperature of individual subsystems spread over the satellite is maintained by a bank of 112 heaters.\nEPS (Electrical Power Subsystem): Electrical power of 550 W is generated by a single panel solar array of 2.15 m x 1.85 m using GaAS solar cells. The solar panel features a drive mechanism to point it into the sun. A single NiCd battery (18 Ah capacity) provides power for eclipse phases. The SADA (Solar Array Driver Assembly) slip rings and drive mechanism are modified to meet the power transfer and drive requirements, it is mass-optimized.\nThe spacecraft has a launch mass of 1055 kg including 560 kg of propellant (495 kg S/C dry mass). MetSat-1 has a design life of 7 years with an operational goal of 10 years.",

The VHRR observes in VIS, water vapor and TIR bands providing a spatial resolution of 2 km in VIS band and 8 km for the rest. VHRR was developed by SAC (Satellite Application Center), Ahmedabad, India. The instrument operates in three scanning modes:\nFull frame mode (20° North-South x 20° East-West), minimum in about 33 minutes covering the entire Earth disk\nNormal frame mode (14° N-S x 20° E-W), minimum in about 23 minutes\nSector frame mode in which the sector can be positioned anywhere in steps of 0.5° in the N-S direction to cover 4.5° N-S x 20° E-W. This mode is particularly suited for rapid, repetitive coverage during severe weather conditions like a cyclone.\nThe nominal frame repetition rates are: 40, 30 and 20 minutes respectively. VHRR is an opto-mechanical system (whiskbroom type imager). The incoming solar radiation is reflected onto a Ritchey-Chretien telescope of 20 cm aperture by a beryllium scan mirror mounted at 45° to the optical axis. The optical system includes a gold-film dichoric beam-splitter that transmits visible light energy and reflects WV/TIR energy, so that the radiation from the Earth is channelized to the visible and IR focal planes simultaneously.\nThe visible band detector configuration consists of two staggered arrays of four silicon photodiodes each; while two sets of mercury-cadmium telluride (MCT) detector elements operating nominally at 100-110 K sense the WV/thermal radiation. The scan mirror is mounted on a two-axis, gimballed scan mechanism system to generate a 2-D image by sweeping the detector instantaneous field of view (FOV) across the Earth's surface in east to west (fast scan) and north to south (slow scan).\nImaging modes of the VHRR instrument\nImaging mode\nCoverage\nRepeatability\nFull scan\n20° N-S and 20° E-W\n33 min\nNormal scan\n14° N-S and 20° E-W\n23 min\nSector scan\n4.5° N-S and 20° E-W\n23 (3 times)\nImaging modes of the VHRR instruments\nChannel\nNo of detectors\nMTF (Modulation Transfer Function)\nDynamic range\nNoise performance\nVIS\n4 +4 redundant\n> 0.23 approx.\n0-100% albedo\n6 : 1 min at 2.5% albedo\nWater Vapor (WV)\n1 + 1 redundant\n> 0.21 approx.\n4-340 K\n0.25 K at 300 K\nTIR\n1 + 1 redundant\n> 0.21 approx.\n4-320 K\n0.5 K at 300 K\nSchematic illustration of the VHRR instrument\nVHRR Instrument\nSpectral band: VIS\nSpectral band: TIR\nSpectral band: MWIR (Water vapor)\n0.55 - 0.75 µm; Integrated out-of-band response <3%\nInter detector mismatch < 5% 10.5 - 12.5 µm; Integrated out-of-band response <3%\nOut-of-band response peak < 0.1% 5.7 - 7.1 µm\nSpatial resolution VIS\nSpatial resolution TIR and MWIR\n56 µrad (or 2 km x 2 km)\n224 µrad (or 8 km x 8 km)\nRadiometric performance: SNR\nRadiometric performance: NEDT\n> 6 for VIS at 2.5% albedo\n< 0.25 K at 300 K for IR channel\nDynamic range of TIR/MWIR channels\nDynamic range of VIS channel\n4-340 K\n0-100%\nMisregistration between VIS and IR\n<56 µrad\nModulation Transfer Function (MTF)\n> 21% for IR and TIR; >23% for VIS channel\nDRT (Data Relay Transponder)\nThe DRT (Data Relay Transponder) is part of a DCS (Data Collection System) of ISRO. The objective is to collect data from unattended meteorological platforms in the ground segment. DRT receives receives signals from unattended weather data collection platforms and retransmits them to the central station. The data from these payloads are being used for comprehensive weather status and forecasting.\nRF communication of DRT: Uplink frequency = 402.75 MHz; downlink frequency = 4506.05 MHz; bandwidth =± 100 kHz; EIRP = 21 dBW (min).\nNote: MetSat-1 does not carry SAS&R (Satellite Aided Search and Rescue) system. In the INSAT-2 series, the INSAT-2A and -2B satellites carried SAS&R transponders as well as DRTs (Data Relay Transponders). According to ISRO information, INSAT-3A (launch April 9, 2003) and INSAT-3D (to be launched subsequently), will carry SAS&R and DRT payloads.",

The Megha-Tropiques mission goals are as follows:\nTo provide, simultaneous measurements of several elements of the atmospheric water cycle (water vapour, clouds, condensed water in clouds, precipitation and evaporation),\nTo measure the corresponding radiative budget at the top of the atmosphere,\nTo ensure high temporal sampling in order to characterize the life cycle of the convective systems and to obtain significant statistics.\nThe payloads have swaths of around 1700-200km. It is necessary to measure the above parameters for a minimum duration of 3 years in order to observe the inter-annual variability and getting an opportunity to observe El Nino-type events in the tropics.\nThe satellite is launched into a non-sun synchronous orbit, unlike other IRS spacecraft. This Megha-Tropiques satellite carries four payloads namely, MADRAS-a microwave imager, SAPHIR-scanning radiometer instrument, SCARAB-scanner for radiative budget and GPS occultation receiver for atmospheric studies.

For realizing that performance, it is necessary to choose channels for which the atmospheric contribution to the radiance comes from different levels of the troposphere. This can be obtained by sampling an absorption line of water vapour by channels more or less close to the centre of the line. A candidate line, already chosen for other instruments, is the line at 183.3 GHz. It is possible to get contribution functions peaking from heights of 2 km.up to 10 to 12 km in tropical redundant to use more than 5 channels. A sixth complimentary channel in a window regions has to be used to correct for the surface effects in the lowest channels; the 150 channel of MADRAS can be used for that. This is the principle of SAPHIR instrument, which has been studied in the frame of micro satellites.\nGeophysical Parameters\nHumidity Profile\nChannel No.\nCentre Frequencies(GHz)\nMax.

Kinetic energy of mesoscale variability is one order of magnitude more than mean circulation's one. Description of mesoscale is thus essential for understanding ocean dynamics, including mean circulation and its climatic effects (through interactions of meso-scale turbulence with the mean flow).\nSARAL/AltiKa main scientific objective is divided in sub-themes including:\nIntrinsic scientific studies of ocean at meso-scale dynamics: observations, theoretical analyses, modelling, data assimilation, parameterization, ...\nImprovement of our understanding of the oceanic component in the climate system: investigation of local processes at small or medium scale poorly known and understood at present, but which have an impact on the modelling of climate variability at large spatial and temporal scales.\nContribution to the study of coastal dynamic processes, especially small or medium scale phenomena, whose retrieval will enable to anticipate many downstream applications.\nContribution to operational oceanography which is seeking large amounts of in situ and space observation data.\nSARAL/AltiKa secondary objectives are notably the monitoring of the main continental waters level (lakes, rivers, closed seas), the monitoring of mean sea level variations, the observation of polar oceans, the analysis and forecast of wave and wind fields, the study of continental ices (thanks to improved performances of Ka-band) and sea ices, the access to low rains climatology (enabled in counterpart to the sensitivity of Ka-band to clouds and low rains) and the marine biogeochemistry (notably through the role of the meso and sub-meso-scale physics).",

Two are Indian and one is from the Italian Space Agency.\nOcean Colour Monitor (OCM)\nScanning Scatterometer (SCAT)\nRadio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA)\nOcean Colour Monitor (OCM)\nOCM is an 8-band multi-spectral camera operating in the Visible and Near IR spectral range. This camera provides an instantaneous geometric field of view of 360 meter and a swath of 1420 km. OCM can be tilted up to + 20 degree along track.\nScanning Scatterometer (SCAT)\nSCAT is an active microwave device designed and developed at ISRO/SAC, Ahmedabad. It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 50 x 50 km. It consists of a parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter which is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. It is an improved version of the one on Oceansat-1. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90\n0\nand the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60\n0\non the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.\nRadio Occultation Sounder for Atmospheric Studies (ROSA)\nROSA is a new GPS occultation receiver provided by ASI (Italian Space Agency). The objective is to characterize the lower atmosphere and the ionosphere, opening the possibilities for the development of several scientific activities exploiting these new radio occultation data sets.",

The three-axis stabilized geostationary satellite carries two meteorological instruments: a six channel Imager and an IR Sounder. Along with the channels in Visible, Middle Infrared, Water Vapor and Thermal Infrared bands, the Imager includes a SWIR channel for wider applications. The Sounder will have eighteen narrow spectral channels in three IR bands in addition to a channel in visible band. It also has a Data Relay Transponder and Satellite based Search & Rescue Payload. Several innovative technologies like on-the-fly correction of scan mirror pointing errors, biannual yaw rotation of the spacecraft, micro-stepping SADA, star sensors and integrated bus management unit have been incorporated to meet the stringent payload requirements like pointing accuracies, thermal management of IR detectors and concurrent operation of both instruments.\nA passive radiant cooler is used to cool the infrared detectors of imager and sounder instruments. The detectors temperature is maintained at 95 K (BOL) and 100 K (EOL). The passive cooler is also to maintain the sounder filter wheel temperature at 213 K.",

    "mission_details": "INSAT-3DS Payloads\nT\nhe satellite has 3 payloads:\nMeteorological (MET) - IMAGER and SOUNDER\nData Relay Transponder (DRT)\nSatellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R)\nMeteorological Payload\nThe INSAT-3DS spacecraft incorporates advanced Imager and Sounder instruments.\nIMAGER\nThe INSAT-3DS imager provides imaging capability of the earth disc from geostationary altitude in one visible (0.52 - 0.72 micrometers) and five infrared; 1.55 - 1.70(SWIR), 3.80 - 4.00(MIR), 6.50 - 7.00 (water vapour), 10.2 - 11.2 (TIR-1) and 11.5 - 12.5 (TIR-2) bands. The ground resolution at the sub-satellite point is nominally 1km x 1km for visible and SWIR bands, 4km x 4km for one MIR and both TIR bands and 8km x 8km for WV band.\nT\nhe Imager is an improved design of VHRR/2 (Very High Resolution Radiometer) heritage instrument flown on the Kalpana-1 and INSAT-3A missions. The instrument features 6 spectral bands (against the 3 bands in previous versions) offering an improved 1 km resolution in the visible band for the monitoring of meso scale phenomena and severe local storms. The two new SWIR and MWIR bands with a resolution of 1 km and 4 km, respectively, will enable better land-cloud discrimination and detection of surface features like snow. One more significant improvement is the split-band TIR channel with two separate windows in 10.2-11.2 and 11.5-12.5 Micrometer regions with a 4 km resolution.\nThis new element enables the extraction of sea surface temperature over the Indian region with a far greater accuracy since the dual-window algorithm can be applied to eliminate the atmospheric attenuation effects. The 1 km resolution of the visible channel and 4 km resolution of the thermal IR channels indirectly improve the accuracy of the derived products like outgoing longwave radiation and cloud motion vectors.\nKey Parameters of the Imager\nTelescope aperture\n310 mm diameter\nNumber of bands (6)\n0.52 - 0.72 µm, VIS (Visible) 1.55 - 1.70 µm, SWIR (Short Wave Infrared) 3.80 - 4.00 µm, MWIR (Mid Wave Infrared) 6.50 - 7.00 µm, WV (Water Vapor) 10.2 - 11.2 µm, TIR-1 (Thermal Infrared) 11.5 - 12.5 µm, TIR-2 (Thermal Infrared)\nSpatial resolution\n1 km for VIS and SWIR 4 km for MWIR 8 km for WV 4 km for TIR-1 and TIR-2\nBand separation, band definition\nBeam splitter, interference filters\nIFOV (Instantaneous Field of View)\n28 µrad for VIS and SWIR (1 km) 112 µrad for MWIR, TIR-1, & TIR-2 (4 km) 224 µrad for WV (8 km)\nSampling interval\n1.75 samples / IFOV for VIS, SWIR,MIR & TIR-1 / -2 3.5 samples / IFOV for WV\nScan step angle\nLinear in E-W direction (8 µR step size)\nLine step 224 µrad in N-S direction\nScan rate Scan linearity Inflight calibration\n200º/s +0.2 s turnaround time\n56 µR (peak to peak)\nFull aperture blackbody and spaceview\nScan modes\nFull, normal and programmable sector for quick repetivity\nFrame time\n25 minutes for normal mode\nSignal quantization\n10 bit/sample\nDownlink data rate\n4.0 Mbit/s\nSOUNDER\nThe INSAT-3DS sounder has 18 infrared channels distributed over longwave and shortwave bands. A visible channel provides synoptic view of the clouds and the earth to aid in generating three dimensional map of temperature and moisture structure of the atmosphere.\nT\nhe Sounder is a first time instrument of the geostationary INSAT series designed and developed at ISRO. The overall objective is to measure the temperature and humidity profiles (vertical distributions) to obtain a three-dimensional representation of the atmosphere. The instrument requirements call for soundings at 10 km ground resolution every 3 hours for a full frame scan. This enables the derivation of vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. These vertical profiles can then be used to derive various atmospheric stability indices and other parameters such as atmospheric water vapor content and total column ozone amount.\nKey Parameters of the sounder\nTelescope aperture\n310 mm diameter\nNumber of bands (6)\n18 Infrared + 1 Visible\nBand definition\nFilter wheel with interference filters\nIFOV (Instantaneous Field of View)\n280 µrad x 280 rad, corresponding to 10 km x 10 km on the surface\nSampling interval\n280 µrad E-W / N-S\nNo of simultaneous soundings\n4 per band\nScan step angle\n10 km E-W, every 0.1 s, and 40 km N-S after completion of E-W scan, 150 µR rms\nStep and dwell time\n0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 s\nTurnaround time\n0.1 s per scan\nIn-flight calibration\nFull aperture blackbody and space view\nScan modes\nOptions provided to cater to quick dynamic environmental phenomena\nFrame time\n160 minutes for 6000 km x 6000 km area sounding\nSignal quantization\n13 bit/sample\nDownlink data rate\n40 kbit/s\nFrame time\n90 kg, (without cooler), 100 W\nSpectral parameters and sensitivity of the sounder\nBand No.\nCenter wavelength µm (cm-1)\nBandwidth µm (cm-1)\nNEDT at 300 K (typical) K\n1\n14.71 (680)\n0.281 (13)\n1.5\n2\n14.37 (696)\n0.268 (13)\n1\n3\n14.06 (711)\n0.256 (13)\n0.5\n4\n13.96 (733)\n0.298 (16)\n0.5\n5\n13.37 (749)\n0.286 (16)\n0.5\n6\n12.66 (790)\n0.481 (30)\n0.3\n7\n12.02 (832)\n0.723 (50)\n0.15\n8\n11.03 (907)\n0.608 (50)\n0.15\n9\n9.71 (1030)\n0.235 (25)\n0.2\n10\n7.43 (1425)\n0.304 (55)\n0.2\n11\n7.02 (1425)\n0.394 (80)\n0.2\n12\n6.51 (1535)\n0.255 (60)\n0.2\n13\n4.57 (2188)\n0.048 (23)\n0.2\n14\n4.52 (2210)\n0.047 (23)\n0.15\n15\n4.45 (2245)\n0.045 (23)\n0.15\n16\n4.13 (2420)\n0.0683 (40)\n0.15\n17\n3.98 (2513)\n0.0683 (40)\n0.15\n18\n3.74 (2671)\n0.140 (100)\n0.15\n19\n0.695 (14367) 0.05 (1000) (0.67-0.72)\n0.1% albedo\nCommunication Payload\nCommunication transponders are required to be configured to provide continuity of some of the INSAT services. A total satellite mass of 2000kg is considered for the launch compatibility, and 70 kg (approximately) of mass apportionment is done for the communication payload components. The communication payload components are - Meteorological Transmitter, Data Relay Transponder, Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R) Transponder & S-band Broadcast Satellite Services Transponder.",

It is used to determine ocean surface level wind vectors through estimation of radar backscatter. The scatterometer system has a 1-m parabolic dish antenna and a dual feed assembly to generate two pencil beams and is scanned at a rate of 20.5 rpm to cover the entire swath. The Ku-band pencil beam scatterometer is an active microwave radar operating at 13.515 GHz providing a ground resolution cell of size 25 x 25 km. The parabolic dish antenna of 1 meter diameter is offset mounted with a cant angle of about 46 degree with respect to earth viewing axis. This antenna is continuously rotated at 20.5 rpm using a scan mechanism with the scan axis along the +ve Yaw axis. By using two offset feeds at the focal plane of the antenna, two beams are generated which will conically scan the ground surface. The back scattered power in each beam from the ocean surface is measured to derive wind vector. The inner beam makes an incidence angle of 48.90\n0\nand the outer beam makes an incidence angle of 57.60\n0\non the ground. It covers a continuous swath of 1400 km for inner beam and 1840 km for outer beam respectively. The inner and outer beams are configured in horizontal and vertical polarization respectively for both transmit and receive modes. The aim is to provide global ocean coverage and wind vector retrieval with a revisit time of 2 days.\nParameter\nInner beam\nOuter beam\nOrbital altitude\n720 km\nInstrument frequency\n13.515 GHz (Ku-band)\nWind speed range\n3-30 m/s, accuracy of 1.8 m/s (rms) or 10%\nWind direction\n0\n0\nto 360\n0\n, accuracy of 20\n0\nrms\nWind vector cell size (resolution)\n25 km x 25 km grid\nPolarization\nHH\nVV\nSwath width\n1400 km\n1840 km\nScanning circle radius\n700 km\n920 km\nScanning rate\n20.5 rpm",
