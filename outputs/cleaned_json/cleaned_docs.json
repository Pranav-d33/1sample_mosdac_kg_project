Introduction\nIndia successfully launched its advanced meteorological satellite INSAT-3DR on 26th September\n2016 in the geostationary orbit at 74ÔÇ∞E. The inheritance of this satellite has come from INSAT-3D\nsatellite. Meteorological payloads onboard INSAT-3DR are a 6 channel Imager and a 19 channel\nSounder mainly for atmospheric profiles, cyclone and monsoon monitoring, cloud motion vectors\nwinds, rainfall estimation, floods/intense precipitation monitoring, snow cover detection,\nmesoscale studies etc. Apart from a 19 channel Sounder in INSAT-3D/3DR, the Imager has a split-\nwindow (TIR1/2), mid-IR (MIR) window, and shortwave IR (SWIR) channels in additions to\nearlier INSAT-3A/Kalpana VHRR. Details of the INSAT-3D/3DR Imager channels are given in\nTable-1. The spectral response functions (SRF) of TIR1 &2, MIR and WV bands of INSAT-3D\nare shown in figure (1) along with brightness temperature spectra of Infrared Atmospheric\nSounding Interferometer (IASI) for a standard tropical atmosphere.\n2\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\nTable-1: Imager channels‚Äô characteristics\nBand# (Name) Wavelength(Œºm) Resolution (km) SNR or NEDT (K)\n1 (VIS) 0.52 ‚Äì 0.72 1 150:1\n2 (SWIR) 1.55 ‚Äì 1.70 1 150:1\n3 (MIR) 3.80 ‚Äì 4.00 4 0.27\n4 (WV) 6.50 ‚Äì 7.00 8 0.18\n5 (TIR1) 10.3 ‚Äì 11.2 4 0.10\n6 (TIR2) 11.5 ‚Äì 12.5 4 0.25\nFig. 1: Convolved SRFs of infrared channels of INSAT-3D Imager superimposed on IASI Tb\nspectra\nSea surface temperature is derived from the split thermal window channels (10.3-11.2ÔÅ≠m, 11.5 ‚Äì\n12.5ÔÅ≠m) during daytime and using additional midwave-IR window channel (3.8 ‚Äì 4.0 ÔÅ≠m) during\nnighttime over cloud free oceanic regions. The most important part of the SST retrieval from IR\nobservations is the atmospheric correction. Especially over tropics, this atmospheric correction is\ndominated by the high variability in vertical distribution of the intervening atmospheric water\n3\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\nvapor. This correction is determined through suitable characterization of tropical atmosphere in\nthe radiative transfer model to simulate the brightness temperatures of INSAT-3D/3DR channels\nand then generating the regression coefficients for SST retrieval. Details of the algorithm have\nbeen given in section 3.1.\n2.1 Overview and background\nThis algorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) describes the current operational algorithm for\nthe retrieval of sea surface temperature from INSAT-3D/3DR Imager channels data. While effort\nhas been made to make this document as complete as possible, it should be recognized that\nalgorithm development is an evolving process. This document (V1.1) is a description of the revised\nalgorithm for INSAT-3D/3DR sea surface temperature estimation as it currently exists, and is\nbeing delivered for inclusion in the INSAT-3D/3DR processing scheme.\nCurrent research on the physics of the atmospheric transmission in the infrared, the processes at\nthe ocean surface, and new information about the performance of the satellite will lead to periodic\nrevisions of the algorithms. Also, the document may appear incomplete in places as research\ncontinues to improve our understanding of the processes at work. Subsequent revisions of the\ndocument will reflect new knowledge and, it is hoped, fill the gaps in what is reported here.\n2.2 Objective\nDevelopment of complete application software package for derivation of SST using multi-channel\nImager data from INSAT-3D/3DR.\n2.3 Inputs\n2.3.1 Static Data\nParameter Resolution Accuracy Source\nLand /Sea Mask Pixel ( ~4 km) 1 pixel USGS(available)\nClimatological SST data 0.25 X 0.25 degree 0.5 K Reynolds\n4\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\n2.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Res.

Algorithm Functional Specifications\n3.1 Overview\n3.1.1 Theoretical Background\nRadiance from Earth‚Äôs terrestrial emission peaks at around 10 ÔÅ≠m and it has minimum attenuation\nby atmospheric gases. Hence in order to measure earth‚Äôs surface temperature, space borne sensors\nare designed around this band (8-12ÔÅ≠m). Still this band is not completely transparent. Atmospheric\nwater vapour and CO are the major constituents that attenuate the IR signal reaching at the top of\n2\nthe atmosphere in this wavelength band. Since CO is a uniformly mixed gas, its effect can be\n2\ntaken care, but water vapour being highly variable in space and time needs additional information\non total water content in the atmosphere (directly or indirectly). Retrieval of sea surface\n5\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\ntemperature (SST) from thermal infrared window channels (10-12 ÔÅ≠m) requires atmospheric\ncorrection arising due to attenuation of signal by intervening moisture. This correction is more in\ntropics during summer due to higher amount of atmospheric moisture loading (Barton 1983,\nAnding and Kauth 1970, Gohil et al 1994, Mathur & Agarwal 1991, 2002, Shenoy 1999). The\nradiative transfer simulation studies, carried out using diverse training profiles set, have shown\nthat with proper characterization of water vapour in the atmosphere, a suitable algorithm can be\ndeveloped for accurate SST retrieval (<0.7K) using split thermal window and mid IR thermal\nchannels provided the sensor noise is of the order of 0.1K (Fig.2). The simplest of such algorithms\nassume that, for small cumulative amounts of water vapour, the atmosphere is sufficiently optically\nthin that the difference between the measured temperature in any band and the true surface\ntemperature can be parameterized as a simple function of the difference between the measured\ntemperatures in two bands with different atmospheric transmissions.\nLinear algorithms like Multi Channel Sea Surface Temperature (MCSST) are based on a formula\nof the following form for the surface temperature T .\ns\nùëá = ùõº +ùõΩùëá +ùõæ(ùëá ‚àíùëá) (1)\nùë† ùëñ ùëñ ùëó\nwhere, the T‚Äôs are the brightness temperatures in various bands for a given location and Œ±, Œ≤ and\ni\nŒ≥ give the parametrized correction (Deschamps and Phulpin 1980, Llewellyn-Jones et al., 1984),\nor can be derived empirically from good composite sets of surface and satellite observations\n(Prabhakara, et al., 1974).\nAlthough Eq. (1) is easy to implement, it does not permit correction for changes in air mass due to\nscan-angle. Llewellyn-Jones et al., (1984) develop a table from numerical simulations which\npermits modification of Eq. (1) into a form:\nùëá = ùõº +ùõΩ‚Ä≤ùëá +ùõæ‚Ä≤(ùëá ‚àíùëá)+ùõø(ùë†ùëíùëêùúÉ‚àí1) (2)\nùë† ùëñ ùëñ ùëó\nwhere, Œ∏ is the satellite zenith angle and Œ¥ is an additional scan angle coefficient. This approach\nreduces the errors at large scan angles for moist atmospheres by more than 1K. This form, however,\nwhile improving the error behavior at large scan angles, does not adequately control the residual\nbehavior at high temperatures.\nA further generalization of this approach is to posit a non-linear structure for the SST estimator.\nFor that a NLSST (non-linear SST) atmospheric equation uses the form:\n6\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\nùëÜùëÜùëá = ùëé +ùëé ùëá +ùëé (ùëá ‚àíùëá )+ùëé (ùëá ‚àíùëá ).(ùëá ‚àíùëá )+ùëé (ùë†ùëíùëêùúÉ‚àí1).(ùëá ‚àíùëá ) (3)\n0 1 1 2 1 2 3 1 2 1 2 4 1 2\nwhere, SST is the satellite derived SST estimate, T and T are the brightness temperatures of\n1 2\nINSAT-3DR thermal channels (TIR-1 and TIR-2). a a a a and a are the retrieval coefficients\n0, 1, 2, 3 4\nestimated from the regression analysis using collocated simulated brightness temperatures and\nSST. The above equation (3) is currently operational at MOSDAC and IMD, Delhi.\nThe validation results of operational SST with in-situ and MODIS SST products has been\npresented in science team meeting of Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature\n(GHRSST) held at China during 05-09 June, 2017. In the meeting the Science Team members\nsuggested to drop the square term of the difference between brightness temperatures of TIR-1 &\nTIR-2, being used for correcting the atmospheric water vapour contamination. It was point out that\nif there is large noise in thermal channels, the square of their difference may result in large errors\nin SST, which was also observed on many occasions in the operational products. Therefore, based\non the recommendations from GHRSST Science Team and subsequent validation analysis of the\noperational SST products, the SST retrieval algorithm has been modified to address this issue of\nlarge errors in SST due to non-linear WV correction term.\nThe revised algorithm follows Walton et al. (1998) for SST retrieval which has the following form:\nDay-time:\nùëÜùëÜùëá = ùëé +ùëé ùëá +ùëé (secŒ∏‚àí1)+ùëé ùëá .(ùëá ‚àíùëá )+ùëé (ùë†ùëíùëêùúÉ‚àí1).(ùëá ‚àíùëá ) (4)\n0 1 1 2 3 ùë†ùëìùëê 1 2 4 1 2\nNight-time:\nùëÜùëÜùëá = ùëé +ùëé ùëá +ùëé (secŒ∏‚àí1)+ùëé ùëá .(ùëá ‚àíùëá )+ùëé (ùë†ùëíùëêùúÉ‚àí1).(ùëá ‚àíùëá ) (5)\n0 1 3 2 3 ùë†ùëìùëê 1 2 4 1 2\nwhere, T is the brightness temperature of MIR channel. T is the a priori estimate of SST that can\n3 sfc\nbe taken from the climatology or from the forecast of the numerical weather prediction models.\nAll other variables are same as in equation (3). The multiplication factor T is used to scale the\nsfc\ncorrection factor due to atmospheric water vapor. We have also tried to experiment with the\nbrightness temperature of TIR1 as a multiplying factor, which yields very similar result. However,\nin order to avoid occasional large noise in the TIR1 BT we retain T as the multiplying factor as\nsfc\nin the original algorithm proposed by Walton et al. (1998).\n3.1.2 Radiative Transfer Model\nSince frequency bands and their spectral response functions of INSAT-3DR and INSAT-3D are\nalmost similar, the transmission coefficients file of INSAT-3D required to simulate brightness\n7\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\ntemperatures through PFAAST radiative transfer (RT) model can be used for simulating INSAT-\n3DR brightness temperatures. Therefore, we have simulated the brightness temperatures\ncorresponding to INSAT-3DR thermal and mid-IR channels through PFAAST RT model. The\natmospheric profiles and required surface variables has been taken from ECMWF diverse data set.\nThe simulations have been performed for the clear atmospheres over oceanic region spanning from\n0ÔÇ∞E ‚Äì 130ÔÇ∞E and 60ÔÇ∞S ‚Äì 60ÔÇ∞N only, and for satellite zenith angle from 0 to 60 degrees.\n3.1.3 Cloud detection\nIn the present algorithm, the cloudy pixels are flagged using INSAT-3DR level-2 cloud mask\nproduct. In absence of the INSAT-3DR cloud mask product the cloudy pixels are detected through\ncloud mask routine based on threshold and spatial coherence techniques in visible, MIR and\nthermal bands. Threshold technique assumes that over oceans in Indian domain brightness\ntemperature in thermal band (TIR-1) is greatly affected by the presence of clouds, resulting in\ndecreased brightness temperature from cold cloud tops. Spatial coherence method is based on the\nassumption that SST is homogeneous in smaller spatial domain and sufficiently warmer than\nclouds; thus clouds can be identified where the scene brightness temperature has lower mean value\nor larger standard deviation. In addition to above the following thresholds criteria as described in\nATBD of MODIS (Ackerman et al., 2006) cloud mask product have also been used.\nDuring day time the reflection in MIR channels dominates over emission; therefore, in general\nMIR BT can be higher than TIR-1 BT by up to ~6K for clear-sky. However, for MIR channel the\nreflection coefficient is higher for cloud top than earth‚Äôs surface. Hence the difference of TIR1 and\nMIR BTs becomes more negative for cloudy sky. The visible reflectance is very high for clouds\nas compared to earth‚Äôs surface. Hence, higher visible albedo (>5 %) or reflectance corresponds to\ncloudy sky. During day-time (solar zenith angle < 80 degree) the following threshold criterion has\nbeen used to detect cloudy pixels:\nùëá ‚àíùëá < ‚àí6.0 & (ùë£ùëñùë†ùëñùëèùëôùëí ùëêùëúùë¢ùëõùë° > 70 ùëúùëü ùëéùëôùëèùëíùëëùëú > 5)\n1 3\nwhere, T and T are the brightness temperatures of TIR-1 and MIR channels of INSAT-3D/3DR,\n1 3\nrespectively.\nDuring night there is no solar reflection at MIR wavelength hence satellite measures only emitted\nradiation. Since cloud emissivity is lower for MIR as compared to TIR-1 wavelength, the\nbrightness temperature corresponding to MIR will be smaller than that of TIR-1 BT for cloudy\npixels. Hence, during night-time (solar zenith angle >= 80 degree) the following threshold is used\nto mask the cloudy pixels:\n8\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\nùëá ‚àíùëá > ‚àí1.0\n1 3\nSST is computed only over clear oceanic regions.\n3.1.4 Error Analysis\nA simulation based sensitivity study of noise in TIR-1 & TIR-2 channels‚Äô BTs on the SST retrieval\nhas been carried out to analyze the errors in the retrieved SST. The simulations have been\nperformed through PFAAST radiative transfer model using atmospheric profiles from ECMWF\ndiverse training dataset for INSAT-3D spectral response functions. The following figure (2) is\nshowing the impact of noise in both the channels on the errors in the retrieved SST. From the figure\nit can be clearly pointed out that if both the channels have uncertainty of 0.1K, the theoretical error\nin retrieved SST would be ~ 0.7K. If uncertainty in both the channels is ~0.05K the minimum\npossible error in the retrieved SST would be 0~.55K.\nFig. 2: Sensitivity of total noise in the retrieval of SST from INSAT-3D Imager\nIt can also be inferred from the figure (2) that using split-window channels the best possible SST\naccuracy of 0.5K could be achieved. For getting better than 0.5K accuracy, one should opt other\natmospheric WV correction techniques as used in ATSR mission which gives approximately 0.3K\n(Mutlow, et al., 1994; Minnett, 1988; Barton, et al., 1993) errors in retrieved SST. In ATSR dual-\nview configuration has been used to correct the atmospheric WV. The Superiority of the dual-view\n9\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\nalgorithm over single-view split-window algorithm lies in the fact that use of the cleaner window\nfor atmospheric correction using second view with larger path-length reduces the uncertainty that\narises in the split window algorithm due to larger uncertainties in the attenuation in the second\nsplit-window channel due to highly variable atmospheric water vapor.\n3.2 Algorithm Flowchart\nFig. 3: Flow-chart of SST Retrieval from INSAT-3DR Imager\n10\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\n3.3 Operational Implementation\nThe implementation is done in the following steps:\nStep-1. Reading of the grey counts, geolocation, satellite and solar zenith angles.\nStep-2. Determine brightness temperatures from grey counts using the lookup table.\nStep-3. Mask the land pixels using land/sea mask.\nStep-4. Processing for discrimination between brightness temperatures from cloud free sea surface\nand those from the cloud tops as discussed in section 3.1.3.\nStep-5. Computation of SST\nFor cloud-free pixels, SST is computed as\nùëÜùëÜùëá = ùëé +ùëé ùëá +ùëé (ùë†ùëíùëêùúÉ‚àí1)+ùëé ùëá .(ùëá ‚àíùëá )+ùëé (ùë†ùëíùëêùúÉ‚àí1).(ùëá ‚àíùëá )\n0 1 1 2 3 ùë†ùëìùëê 1 2 4 1 2\n(a = 15.3364, a = 0.9535, a =- 0.8215, a = 0.0072,a =0.5144 for INSAT-3DR)\n0 1 2 3 4\n(a = 15.8150, a = 0.9519, a =- 0.8544, a = 0.0075,a =0.5340 for INSAT-3D)\n0 1 2 3 4\nwhere, a‚Äôs and b‚Äôs are the retrieval coefficients, T , T and T are the brightness temperatures of\n1 2 3\nTIR-1, TIR-2. T has been taken from the daily SST climatology.\nsfc\nStep-6. Quality control/Editing of derived SST\nOnly those SST values will be retained for which the following condition holds:\n(ùëÜùëÜùëá ‚àí3ùúé) ‚â§ ùëÜùëÜùëá ‚â§ (ùëÜùëÜùëá +3ùúé)\nùëêùëôùëñùëö ùëêùëôùëñùëö\nwhere, œÉ is the standard deviation of the daily climatological SST and SST is the daily value of\nclim\nclimatological SST.\n3.4 Output\nSST maps and data (HDF5) are available every half hourly, daily, weekly, monthly and seasonally.\nParameter Min (K) Max (K) Theoretical Accuracy Resolution\n~0.7-0.8 K Pixel (~4 km)\nSST(day) 285 310 (with 0.10-0.15 K\nnoise)\n11\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\n3.4.1 Format of the output and the domain\nHDF5 data sets : Latitude, Longitude, SST, Quality flag\nDomain : 400 S to 400 N, 300 E to 1200 E\n3.5 Validation\nThe extensive validation of the derived SST will be done using all the available data from buoys,\nspecial cruise by research vessels and available similar products from various satellite missions.\n3.5.1 Initial validation\nPreliminary validation of SST retrieved through the proposed algorithm for both INSAT-3D &\n3DR with concurrent in-situ as well as MODIS/Aqua SST been performed for 11-18 December,\n2017. Comparison of operational products have also been performed with same in-situ SST data\nfor the same period. We have taken 0.040 spatial resolution and 15 minutes‚Äô temporal resolution\nfor collocation. The daily products have also been compared with GHRSST (Group for High\nResolution SST) daily SST products for the same period.\n3.5.1.1 Comparison with in-situ:\nThe in situ records acquired from In-situ quality monitor (Iquam) portal hosted by National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) are first temporally matched-up against the\nINSAT-3D/3DR extractions. To limit variability introduced by the time separation between the\ntwo data sources, the absolute difference between the time of the in situ SST measurement and the\ntime at which that location is viewed by the INSAT-3D/3DR (i.e., the matchup time window) is\nrestricted to a maximum of ¬±15 minutes. In situ records that do not fall within the stipulated time\nwindow will be rejected. The in situ records that pass the temporal matchup subsequently have to\npass a spatial test.\nThe figures 4(a) and 4(b) are showing the scatter plot of INSAT-3D SST retrieved through new\nand operational algorithm with respect to concurrent in-situ SST measurements while figures 5(a)\nand 5(b) are showing the same for INSAT-3DR SST.\n12\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\n(a) (b)\nFig. 4: Scatter plot of INSAT-3D SST with in-situ SST (a) Operational (b) New\n(a) (b)\nFig. 5: Scatter plot of INSAT-3DR SST with in-situ SST (a) Operational (b) New\nFrom above figures (4) and (5), it can be seen that the spread is less in new SST as compared to\noperational SST when compared with same in-situ data for both satellites. This clearly indicates\nan improvement in SST when retrieved using proposed algorithm than the operational SST. The\ncorrelation coefficient also shows an improvement.\n13\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\n3.5.1.2 Comparison with MODIS/Aqua:\nA preliminary comparison of SST retrieved using new as well as operational algorithm for both\nINSAT-3D & 3DR satellites has been carried out with MODIS/Aqua SST for the same period of\n11-18, December 2017. Figures (6-7) are showing the density scatter plot for both the products:\nnew as well as operational for both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR sensors.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 6: Density plot of retrieved INSAT-3D SST with MODIS (a) Operational (b) New SST\n(a) (b)\nFig. 7: Density plot of retrieved INSAT-3D SST with MODIS (a) Operational (b) New\n14\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\nThe quantitative comparison in terms of correlation coefficient, mean difference (bias), the\nstandard deviation of the difference (Std) with respect to MODIS SST has also been shown in\nsame figures. From the above figures it is clear that both the bias and Std of new SST are less than\nthat of operational SST when compared with MODIS. Therefore, SST accuracy is improved when\nretrieved using the proposed algorithm.\n3.5.2.3 Comparison with GHRSST DAILY Products:\nAn initial comparison of daily SST products retrieved using new as well as operational algorithm\nfor both INSAT-3D & 3DR satellites has been carried out with GHRSST daily SST products for\nthe same period of 11-18, December 2017. The comparison has been shown by the spatial plots of\nthe differences in both the SST products. The following figures (8) and (9) are showing the spatial\nplots of the differences for INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR, respectively for 11th December 2017.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 8: Difference of daily INSAT-3D SST with GHRSST (a) Operational (b) New\nIt can be clearly seen from the above figures (8) and (9) that except some locations the difference\nbetween INSAT-3D/3DR SST and GHRSST is within ¬±1K when retrieved through proposed\nalgorithm. While the difference between operational SST and GHRSST products is as high as 2.5\nto 3K in case of INSAT-3D and as low as -2.5 to -3K in case of INSAT-3DR. This clearly indicates\nthe superiority of the proposed algorithm over the operational one.\n15\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\n(a) (b)\nFig. 9: Difference of daily INSAT-3DR SST with GHRSST (a) Operational (b) New\n3.6 Applications\nThere are many potential applications of SST. Among those thermal gradient is one of the most\nimportant features of the SST which is required to study various mesoscale oceanic processes as\nwell as a serves as an indicator of potential fishery zones (PFZ). Thermal gradients from GHRSST\ndaily products is shown in figure (10).\nFig. 10: Thermal gradient from daily GHRSST for 13th December 2017.\n16\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\nThe thermal gradients computed from daily products of INSAT-3D/3DR SST retrieved through\nproposed and operational algorithm for 13th December 2017 are shown in the following figures\n(11) and (12). This work has been carried out with our colleagues from oceanic sciences division\n(OSD).\n(a) (b)\nFig. 11: Thermal gradients from daily INSAT-3D SST (a) Operational (b) New\n(a) (b)\nFig. 12: Thermal gradients from daily INSAT-3DR SST (a) Operational (b) New\nOn comparing figures (11) and (12) with figure (10), we can see that for both INSAT-3D & 3DR\nthe SST gradients calculated from the daily SST products retrieved through proposed algorithm is\ncloser to GHRSST gradients as compared to gradients calculated from SST retrieved through\noperational algorithm.\nThe above initial validation exercise confirms the superiority of the proposed algorithm over\nthe operational one.\n17\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/01/2018\n3.7 Technical issues (limitation etc.)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiative transfer model to simulate the\nsatellite radiances, instrument noise and atmospheric correction. Biases in radiative transfer model\nsimulations can be accounted for by validating the derived SST with reliable and concurrent in-\nsitu data. In the absence of split thermal window channel observations and a channel sensitive to\nintervening atmospheric total water vapour content, the atmospheric correction applied is an\nindirect. The accuracy of this correction will heavily depend upon the accuracy of the model\nreanalysis for total water vapour. Major constraints on data quality outside the scope of this effort\nfocus in the following areas: accurate pre-launch instrument characterization, instrument NEŒîT\nfor each band, calibration model performance, availability of quality controlled surface calibration-\nvalidation observations, availability and access to the various quality assessment data sets, and\ntimely access to continuing performance assessment data sets. The on-orbit instrument NEŒîT\nperformance is a primary input to the algorithm error budget.\n3.7 Future Scope\nInitially, this proposed algorithm and bias correction would be used to derive SST. Over a period\nof approximately one year, after complete calibration and validation of the product, bias correction\nand other fine tuning of the coefficients would be carried out. This should improve the accuracy\nof the product to the desired level. Of course, instrument noise also plays a crucial role in\ndetermining the overall accuracy of the product. Generation of regression coefficients for SST\nretrieval from simultaneous satellite and buoy observations data base require nearly 250 buoys\ndistributed over Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and Indian Ocean continuously for minimum 2/3\nyears.\nMoreover, the bias correction as mentioned above is based on the simulated brightness\ntemperatures using ECMWF analysis profiles and PFAAST RT model. Also, ECMWF analysis\nprofiles may also have some biases which can cause the biases in the simulated brightness\ntemperatures. Therefore, in future we will refine this bias correction using radiosonde based\natmospheric profiles. Similarly, RT models also known to have inherent biases.

Abstract: The Hydro-Estimator (H-E) is a INSAT-3D based high\nresolution rain estimation method which combines NCEP\nmodel parameters with satellite observations. The Hydro-\nEstimator developed at SAC is based on similar operational\nmethod at NOAA/STAR. The H-E is operationally\nimplemented. This report addresses the validation of H-E in the\npresent form. It is found that the H-E in its present form works\nwell over most parts of the country but has weakness over hilly\nterrains. The problem is identified and a modified H-E is\nproposed. The modified H-E shows a good representation of\nrain over hill terrains. Overall, it gives a correlation of 0.78 and\nrms difference of 46.64 mm when compared with weakly\nmeteorological subdivision surface measurements. Its\ncomparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 also provides the same\ncorrelation and rms difference. It is also found that comparison\nstatistics of weekly met subdivision averaged surface\nobservations with H-E is nearly same as that with 3B42 V7.\nHowever, the week-by-week comparison of surface\nmeasurements with H-E is more stable than with 3B42 V7. In\ndaily 0.25ox0.25o grid, the correlation and rms difference over\nland between surface observations and H-E is 0.47 and 25.40\nmm/day. A slightly higher correlation of 0.59 and lowered rms\ndifference of 22.40 is observed between H-E and 3B42 V7.\nThese comparison statistics are in agreement with comparison\nof surface observations with 3B42 V7. The similar comparisons\nover oceans are conducted between H-E and 3B42 V7, which\nshow a correlation of 0.65 and rms difference of 15.88 mm/h.\nThe advantage of H-E over 3B42 V7 is its near real time\ndissemination.

Rain\ngauges offer point measurements and thus they do not represent spatial variability of\nthe precipitation that varies from few meters to several kilometers. The distribution of\nthe rain gauges is far from adequate to present the meaningful variability for the study of\nvarious rain-induced events/processes, like flash flood, dam failure, river catchment,\netc. On the other hand, radars are better representative of the areal rain, but their\ncoverage is limited due to their high cost. The radar measurements often suffer due to\npoor calibration of radar reflectivity and also of Z -R relationship. Apart from that,\ne\nground clutter and anomalous propagation also mars its usability. At the time of severe\nweather conditions, ground based observation network often fail to work. In view of the\nlimitations of the ground measurements, the most convenient means to measure the\nprecipitation over large area is by using the satellite-based methods. The satellites offer\nfrequent uniform coverage over large area. However, the satellite measurements also\nsuffer from large errors. While Vis./IR methods suffer from their inability to sense\nhydrometeors directly (Bhandari and Varma, 1995), microwave measurements suffer\ndue to their coarser spatial and temporal resolution, rain variability within their large\nfootprint referred as beam filling problem, uncertainty in the drop-size distribution, drop\ntemperature, fall velocity and shape and orientation of the drops etc. (Varma et al, 2003,\nVarma and Liu, 2006, Varma and Liu, 2010, and Varma and Pal, 2012).\nDue to inherent inability of IR measurements to directly sense the hydrometeors, the\nrain retrieval using them is always indirect in nature. In the past, there are a number of\nmethods developed for rain estimation (barrett and Martin, 1981); they range from very\nsimple algorithms in which brightness temperature (Tb) is directly related to rain rate\n(e.g., Arkin et al., 1989) to those which involved complex hypothetical models (e.g.,\nScofield, 1987). Scofield (1987) described a method for measuring the intense\nprecipitation over a storm. His method called Interactive Flash Flood Analyzer (IFFA)\nthat used half-hourly satellite images to measure the precipitation over the active area\nof a storm. His technique involved the skill of a trained meteorologist to find out active\nportion of a storm. He also utilized the total atmospheric precipitable water (TPW) and\nwater vapour (WV) correction to make modifications for dry/wet environment and\nequilibrium level adjustments for rain that comes from the warm clouds. This method\nwas found to be successful for measuring precipitation but was highly subjective and\nneeded continuous interaction of a trained meteorologist to decide the precipitation\namount. Thus, it was found difficult to implement it with ease. Successively, an\nalternate method called Auto-Estimator (A-E) was developed. The aim of the A-E was to\n3\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nprovide an automated method without human intervention and that could automate the\nsubjective nature of the IFFA, but A-E failed on many occasions because many features\nof IFFA were not properly implemented in it. Hydro-Estimator is most recent of the\nattempts by NOAA/NESDIS to improve and make IFFA automated (Scofield and\nKuligowaski, 2003). The H-E incorporated many new features that were either not\npresent in IFFA or were defined differently.\nA brief summary of the Hydro-Estimator is provided in section 2 below. Further details of\nHydro-Estimator technique can be found in Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document\n(ATBD) (Varma and Gairola, 2013).\n2.0 Hydro-Estimator\nThe H-E method offers improvement over A-E method for precipitation estimation. In A-\nE method, the relationship between 10.7 ÔÅ≠m brightness temperature (Tb) and rain rate\n(mm h-1) (R) is defined as:\n1.2\nR = a exp(-bTb ), -----(1)\nwhere, a and b are regression coefficients having values a= 1.1183*1011; b=0.036382\n(Vicente et al. 1998). The A-E method provides same relationship for core and non-core\nprecipitation. The above equation provides first guess of the precipitation value for core\nrain and is hereafter referred as (R ). In H-E, the rain is determined by the cloud growth\nc\nat the given pixel relative to the surrounding pixels. The H-E method ensures heavier\nrain for growing clouds, in the upwind portion of the storm with overshooting tops. The\ncore and non-core fractions of the precipitation are identified and different R-Tb\nrelationships are provided for them. This allows higher precipitation rates for the\nconvective cores. For convective core, an equation similar to (1) is used, however the\ncoefficients a and b are dynamic in nature, and which depends upon available TPW as\nprovided by National Centre for Environmental Predictions (NCEP/NOAA) Numerical\nWeather Prediction (NWP) model derived fields. This allows higher precipitation value\nfor wetter atmosphere. The above (1) is constrained with precipitation value of 0.5 mm\nh-1 at Tb =240 K, and a precipitable water (from NCEP model) dependent value at Tb\n=210 K. In H-E method, the maximum possible rain at any pixel is limited depending\nupon availability of TPW. This allows the maximum precipitation as a function of\navailable moisture. The maximum possible rain value in mm/h is restricted to 40 times\nthe precipitable water in inches.\nIf a pixel is assigned maximum rain but there exist a colder pixel in its vicinity. In\nprinciple, the rain rate at the colder nearby pixel would be higher. Thus the rain rate\ncurves are recomputed based on rain rate of 0.5 mm/h at 240 K and of the theoretical\nmaximum value at the lowest temperature in the vicinity.\nFor a non-convective core, the relationship between Tb and R is given as:\nn\nRn=(250-Tb) * (Rmax/5) -----------------(2)\n4\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nRmax is again a function of PW. Rn is not allowed to exceed - corresponding R\nc\nrain\nrate or 12 mm/h, whichever is lower.\nIn H-E method, the precipitation at a pixel is considered to comprising of core and non-\ncore fractions. This is worked out by considering an area of 101X101 pixels\nsurrounding the pixel under consideration. The minimum, mean and standard deviation\nof Tb (T ), in this area is determined. This T is used to find the radius of actual\nmin min\nregion of interest. Within this radius of interest, the mean (T ) and standard deviation\nmean\n(ÔÅ≥) of Tbare determined. The active/inactive and also core/non-core fraction of the pixel\nis determined through the parameter Z,\nZ = (T - Tb)/ ÔÅ≥ ----------(3)\nmean\nThe minimum and maximum allowable value of Z are 0 and 1.5.\nIf Z < 0; H-E rain (R) = 0, i.e., pixel either cirrus or inactive convective\nOtherwise, R = [Rc*Z2 + Rn * (1.5 - Z)2] / [Z2 + (1.5 - Z)2] --------------(3)\nR is the rain from the convective core given by (1) with coefficients determined by PW\nc\nfrom NCEP NWP model. R is rain from non-convective core given by (2). If Z=1.5, the\nn\npixel rain rate R reduces to convective type only (given by (1)). On the other hand, if\nZ=0, the pixel rain rate R is determined by purely non-convective rain (given by (2)).\nIn fact, the convective systems generally have multiple brightness temperature minima,\nand hence a single radius is inappropriate for differentiating local from global minima.\nThus, this same computation of rain rate is performed for a smaller (15-pixel) radius,\nand the final rain rate is the square root of the product of the two rates. The exception to\nthis is if the rain rate computed from the smaller radius is zero, in which case it is not\nconsidered in the final rain rate calculation.\nThe (3) above provides the first guess precipitation amounts. The precipitation thus\nestimated is further modified to account for the wetness/dryness of the atmosphere and\nalso for the precipitation that comes from the warm clouds. The several steps involved\nfor such modifications are as follows:\n2.1 Correction for Wet/dry Environment\nA small correction in the brightness temperature (Tb) values is carried out to account for\nwetness of the environment. This adjustment is needed to account for evaporation of\nthe precipitation in the dryer environment below the cloud. A higher or lower value of the\nbrightness temperature at 10.7ÔÅ≠m is set for drier or wetter environment. This is carried\nout in two steps. In the first step, brightness temperature is adjusted based on the TPW\nvalue to compute rain rate from (3). In the second step, first, the relative humidity (RH)\n5\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nitself from the NCEP model is adjusted to account for the falling rain, and then\ndepending upon RH value, a subtraction from the rain amount given by (3) is made.\n2.2 Warm-top modification\nThe equilibrium level or Level of Neutral Buoyancy (LNB) is computed by following a\nparcel along a saturation adiabat upward (from lifting condensation level) to where the\nparcel temperature becomes equal to the environmental temperature. Strength of the\nconvection is determined by a comparing the temperatures of the convective tops with\nthat of equilibrium level. This level lies below tropopause for the warm rain.\nIn H-E method, NCEP model temperature and dewpoint profiles are used to determine\nequilibrium temperature (Teq) of a particulate pixel. This correction is applied to pixels\nthat are warmer than the equilibrium level temperature.\nÔÇ∑ If the (Teq- Tmin) < 10 K, then T\nmin\nin the pixel-area is used instead of Tb of the\npixel for warm top correction. The modification is as follows:\nTb ‚Äì [(213-Teq)*0.9] or 25 K (whichever less)\nÔÇ∑ If the (Teq- Tmin) > 10 K, the modification is as follows\nTb ‚Äì [(213-Teq)*0.6] or 15 K (whichever less)\n2.3 Orographic Correction\nCorrections for the orography induced rain and the rain from warm clouds are also\napplied. This correction is carried out to ensure enhanced rain amounts along windward\nside and reduced rain amounts along leeward side of the mountains. The orographic\ncorrection is carried out by determining by gradient of the elevations in the direction of\nthe prevailing 850 mb level winds (Vicente et al., 2002).\n3.0 Sample Results and comparisons\nThe H-E method which is currently operational at Indian Meteorological Department\n(IMD) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) uses INSAT-3D Imager thermal\ninfrared (TIR) observations at 10.7 ¬µm along with environmental parameters taken from\nNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model to make a quantitative assessment of the\nprecipitation. The H-E technique provides rain rate at each pixel with every acquisition\nof the satellite data (presently, 4x4 km2 and 30 minutes for INSAT-3D). The procedure\nand coefficients are adopted from H-E method developed by NOAA/STAR.\nHydro-Estimator performed reasonably well over the land and oceans. As an example,\nFig. 1 shows the instantaneous H-E rain on 23 September 2013 at 1200 UTC from\nINSAT-3D along with H-E rain as derived by NOAA using Meteosat and rain from\nTRMM 3B41RT. There is a good qualitative agreement between rain rates derived\nusing INSAT-3D and Meteosat. Though H-E rain by NOAA and by us uses the same\n6\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\ntechnique and coefficients, the difference between the two methods still exists due to\ntheir different inputs. While INSAT-3D based H-E algorithm used 0.5ox0.5o gridded 6\nhourly NCEP Global Forecasting System (GFS) model derived parameters whereas\nNOAA algorithm uses high-resolution ETA model derived fields. Nevertheless, there is\ngood qualitative agreement between H-E rain derived from INSAT-3D and Meteosat.\nThere is also fairly good qualitative agreement between H-E rain from INSAT-3D and\nfrom 3B41RT. The 3B41RT is microwave based hourly rain rates.\n(a) (b) (c)\nFig.1: Rain rate in (mm/h) on 23 Sep. 2013 at 1200 UTC from (a) INSAT-3D by SAC,\n(b) GMS by NOAA and (c) TRMM 3B41RT.\nDespite of having good agreement over most of the regions, the rain over the\nHimalayan region is not well picked up by H-E rain from INSAT-3D as well as from\nMeteosat. This issue is dealt in modified H-E that is described in the later part of this\nreport.\nFigure 2 show another example of INSAT-3D derived instantaneous H-E rain\nassociated with Phaillin cyclone from 10 ‚Äì 13 Oct. 2013. The Fig. 2 (a) to (h) shows the\ndevelopment to decay of the cyclone in chronological order. The intense rain associated\nwith eye-wall as well as spiral clouds bands of the cyclone is clearly seen. The H-E also\nvery well picked up the eye of the cyclone as rain-free area. The distribution as well as\nthe intensity of the H-E rain associated with cyclone is found to be in agreement with the\nobserved history of the cyclone (Anonymous, 2014).\nThe cyclone made a landfall on 12 Oct. 2013 at around 1530 UTC and caused intense\nrain in Orissa during 12-14 Oct 2013. The Figure 3 show the district averaged rain rate\nfrom H-E and a network of rain gauges from the state government of Orissa. A good\nagreement can be observed in rain distribution from H-E and surface observations.\nA scatter plot of H-E rain and surface observations from Fig. 3 is shown in Fig. 4.\n7\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\n(a) (b) (c) (d)\n(e) (f) (g) (h)\nFig. 2: Chronlogical history of rain rates associated with Phaillin cyclone from INSAT-3D based\nHydro-Estimator method.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 3: Distribution of the district average rain for the Orissa from (a) H-E and (b) surface\nobservations.\n8\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nFig. 4: Scatter plot of 12-14 Oct 2013 district averaged rain from Orissa from H-E and\nsurface observations.\nThe 3-days, 12-14 Oct. 2013, Orissa state averaged rain associated with the Phaillin\ncyclone from INSAT-3D H-E, surface observations, TRMM-3B42RT and CPC is\nprovided in Table 1.\nTable 1: Orissa state averaged rain associated with Phaillin cyclone from 12-14 Oct.\n2013.\nRain (mm)\nH-E Surface Obs. 3B41RT CPC\n125.89 110.1 60.0 180.0\nThus it can be concluded that INSAT-3D H-E rain is not only in a good qualitatively and\nquantitatively agreement with surface observations but it is also having a good\nagreement in its spatial distribution.\nFurther, we have compared weekly meteorological (met) subdivision averaged rain from\nINSAT-3D H-E with corresponding rain values from IMD generated weekly weather\nreports (WWR) and TRMM-3B42RT for 7 weeks from 29 May to 16 July 2014 of the S-\nW monsoon season. The Fig. 5 shows the inter-comparison of weekly met-subdivision\naveraged rain from H-E, WWR and 3B42RT.\nThe Fig. 5 shows a reasonably good agreement of H-E weekly rain with IMD WWR and\nTRMM-3B42RT. To examine the comparison statistics of H-E rain in better perspective,\nwe have provided the comparison of 3B42RT with IMD WWR. It may be recalled that\n3B42RT is an IR and microwave merged product.\nFurther comparison is made between hourly CPC 1oX1o latitude-longitude gridded rain\nwith H-E rain for period from 23-27 October 2013. The comparison statistics is provided\nin Table 2 below. For comparison in smaller spatial and temporal scales, a comparison\n9\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nof INSAT-3D H-E with TRMM 3B41RT hourly rain in 0.25oX0.25o latitude-longitude grid\nis made for period 20-24 Sep 2014. The TRMM 3B41RT is a microwave derived rain\nproduct and is available hourly.\n(a)\n(b) (c)\nFig. 5: Comparison of weekly meteteorological sub-division averaged rain for 7 weeks\nfrom 29 May to 16 July 2014 between (a) IMD WWR and H-E rain, (b) TRMM-\n3B42RT and H-E rain, and (c) TRMM 3B42RT and IMD WWR.\nTable 2: Comparison statistics of rain from H-E with CPC and 3B41RT\nComparison between CPC and INSAT-3D H-E Rain\nPeriod Time Scale Spatial Grid R Rmsd Bias\n23-27 Oct 2013 Daily 1oX1o 0.69 17.01 mm 3.13 mm\nComparison between 3B41RT and INSAT-3D H-E Rain\n20-24 Sep 2014 Hourly 0.25oX0.25o 0.59 1.06 mm/h 0.12\n4.0 Need for further Improvements in Hydro-Estimator\nThe results presented in section 3.0 above show a reasonable good agreement\nbetween H-E rain and surface observations. The most of the result presented in the\nabove section are dominated by regions that are either oceans or have moderate\nelevations from the sea level. Figure 6 below shows the comparison of IMD Weekly\nWWR met-subdivision accumulated rain for 7 weeks with corresponding H-E rain\naveraged over 4 typical high orographic met-subdivisions, viz. Arunachal Pradesh (AP),\nUttrakhand (UK), Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Jammu and Kashmir (J & K),\nThe Fig. 6 shows that H-E rain estimated for areas with high altitudes is largely\nunderestimated with respect to surface observations. Also, with regard to Fig. 1, as it is\nalready mentioned in section 3.0 that the rain over Himalayan region is not well depicted\nby H-E rain from INSAT-3D as well as that provided by NOAA using Meteosat. In view\nof the observed underestimation of the rain by H-E in the present form over high altitude\nregions, it is desired to investigate its possible reason and accordingly modify the H-E\nmethod to make it able to better represent the rain over high altitudes.\n10\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nFig. 6: Comparison of IMD weekly rain from WWR with corresponding H-E rain in 4 met\nsubdivisions with high altitudes.\n5.0 Modified Hydro-estimator:\nAs discussed the previous section, the H-E is not able to give satisfactory\nmeasurements over high altitudinal regions. This weakness of H-E is noticeable despite\nof the fact that the H-E method is designed with corrections for orography and warm\nrain. Herein we reinvestigated different corrections applied to the H-E method to work\nout procedures to make it better representative of surface observations, especially in\nhigh altitudes.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 7: NCEP GFS model derived (a) TPW and (b) RH for a typical day and time.\nCorrection of NCEP derived TPW and RH\nIt was observed in the NCEP GFS analyzed fields that TPW and RH values are very low\nin the Himalayan region. For example, Fig. 7 shows the TPW (in inch) and RH (in\npercentage) for a typical day and time, which shows very low value over Himalayan\nregion. Such low values of TPW and RH in NCEP GFS fields are observed irrespective\nof date and time of the observation. Such low values are not supportive of the high rain\nrates in H-E method and hence the estimated rain is largely underestimated.\n11\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\n(a) (e)\n(b) (f)\n(g)\n(c)\n(d) (h)\nFig. 8: Conditional probability distributions using July 2014 NCEP GFS model derived\nfields over Indian region of TPW (inch) at (a) 0000 UTC, (b) 0600 UTC, (c) 1200\nUTC and (d) 1800 UTC, and RH (percentage) at (e) 0000 UTC, (f) 0600 UTC, (g)\n1200 UTC and (h) 1800 UTC.\nIn order to examine, TPW and RH values with respect to altitude, we have plotted\nconditional probability distributions (PDF) of TPW (in inch) and RH (in percentage)\nconditioned to different altitudes over Indian region (i.e., 0-40 N and 65-100 E) from one\nfull month (July 2014) of NCEP GFS analyzed fields separately for each of the\nobservation times (i.e., 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC). This is shown in Fig. 8. In\nwhich it can be seen that TPW and RH have nearly same PDFs irrespective of time of\nobservation. Also the TPW and RH values are always very low at high altitudes. For\nexample, for altitude above 4000 m, the TPW is always less that 1 inch and RH is\nalways less than 50%. In order to have their values at higher altitudes comparable to\nthat at lower altitudes, we have carried out histogram matching with respect to their\n12\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\ncorresponding values between 0-500 m values. By histogram matching we intend to\nmake their probability of occurrence same at all altitudes. The Fig. 9 shows the\ncorresponding PDF values before and after histogram matching.\n(a) (c)\n(b) (d)\nFig. 9: Probability distributions at different altitudes with one month of NCEP GFS\nmodel fields at 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC of (a) TPW, (b) TPW after\nhistogram equalization, (c) RH, (d) RH after histogram equalization.\n(b)\n(a)\nFig. 10: (a) TPW, and (b) RH after applying histogram equalization to values in Fig. 7.\n13\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nFigure 9 (a) and (c) show the conditional PDFs of TPW and RH with all time data from\nFig. 8 and Fig. 9 (b) and (d) show them after carrying out histogram equalization. The\nFig. 9 shows that with histogram equalization the probability of occurrence of TPW and\nRH value is nearly same irrespective of altitude. The correction based on histogram\nequalization (Fig. 9) is applied to TPW and RH values shown in Fig. 7. The modified\nTPW and RH values are provided in Fig. 10. The Fig. 10 looks similar to Fig. 7 except\ncorresponding values over Himalayan region which are now have higher values\ncompared to those in Fig. 7. We expect that this correction in TPW and RH will help\ngetting more representative rain values from H-E.\n5.1 Correction of Equilibrium Level / Level of Neutral Buoyancy Computation\nThe Equilibrium Level (EL) or Level of Neutral Buoyancy (LNB) is computed by following\na parcel along a saturation adiabat upward (from lifting condensation level) to where the\nparcel temperature becomes equal to the environmental temperature. Strength of the\nconvection is determined by a comparing the temperatures of the convective tops from\nIR measurements with that of EL. This level comes before tropopause for the warm rain.\nThis adjustment was initially developed to enhance rainfall in regions where the\nconvective EL was too low (in height) for very cold cloud tops to develop, but where\nvery heavy precipitation is still possible.\nIf equivalent potential temperature of the parcel is ÔÅ± and sateurated equivalent potential\ne\ntemperature of the environment is ÔÅ± , then usually a parcel begins with ÔÅ± <ÔÅ± of the\nes e es\nenvironment. As the parcel rises, conserving ÔÅ± , it will eventually have a ÔÅ± equal to the\ne e\nÔÅ± of the environment; this is referred as the level of free convection (LFC). As the\nes\nparcel rises above the LFC, it is positively buoyant and will continue to raise until\neventually ÔÅ± is equal to the ÔÅ± of the environment again, this is referred as EL or LNB.\ne es\nAbove the LNB the parcel becomes negatively buoyant and tends to return to the LNB.\nAssuming adiabatic ascent, i.e., no mixing of environmental air, we can determine the\nLNB for given sounding.\nConventionally, the ÔÅ± and ÔÅ± are determined considering 1000 mb as the reference\ne es\nlevel. We find that by taking 1000 mb as reference the convergence of thermodynamic\nequations above hilly terrain is not always possible, and thereby it does not allow us to\ncarry out correction for warm rain over such regions. Taking cognition of the fact that\n1000 mb is not a realistic level over hilly terrain where surface pressure is often much\nlower. We thus replaced this 1000 mb with surface temperature over hilly terrain in\nthermodynamic equations for ÔÅ± and ÔÅ± . This resulted in more often convergence of\ne es\nequations over hilly terrains. Figure 11 (a) shows the EL/LNB as computed using 1000\nmb as reference surface and Fig. 11 (b) shows the EL/LNB as computed with modified\nalgorithm. One can notice the changes only over some regions (especially, Himalayas,\nHindukush and Arabia) where with modified scheme the computation of LNB is now\npossible.\n14\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\n(b)\n(a)\nFig. 11: LNB calculated with Temperature and RH vertical profiles from NCEP GFS\nmodel fields with (a) 1000 mb as reference surface, (b) actual surface pressure.\n5.2 Modification in orographic correction\nThe orographic correction uses 850 mb wind speed which is unrealistic level over high\naltitudes. The 850 mb level is considered for avoiding the boundary layer for surface\npressure close to 1000 mb level. For high orographic regions, this needs to be modified\nand replaced with realistic level. This is done in the modified algorithm; we can see the\n850 mb u-wind component on a typical date and time in Fig. 12 (a), and modified wind\ninput to orographic correction in Fig. 12 (b). One can see the moderate changes in the\nwind only over orographic regions.\n(b)\n(a)\nFig. 12: From NCEP model fields (a) Wind Speed at 850 mb (b) Wind Speed above\nboundary layer.\n15\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nWith above modifications, we examined the capability of H-E for measuring intense rain\nover Himalayas. Few examples are presented in the next section. We have presented a\ndetailed validation of the modified H-E over all the other regions too.\n6.0 Validation of Modified Hydro-Estimator\nThe above modifications in H-E are aimed at improving rain over orographic regions.\nHence the success of the changes in the H-E depends primarily on its improved\nperformance over Hilly terrain, and its consistent or improved performance over all other\nregions. We have taken two different cases of intense rain over Himalyas which were\npoorly represented by H-E. One is that of flash floods in Uttrakhand from 15-17 June\n2013 which resulted heavy flooding and huge loss of life and property. In June 2013,\nINSAT-3D was not available and hence we applied the modified algorithm to Kalpana-1\nVHRR observations and examined the performance. Figure 13 shows the rain over\nUttrakhand region in the morning of 17 June 2013 when scores or people were perished\nin Kedarnath, Badrinath and other adjoining regions. The Fig. 13 (a) is H-E rain\nmeasurements without applying modifications and Fig. 13 (b) shows the H-E rain with\nmodifications as described in section 5.0. We can see the mark difference in the rain\nintensity with corrections.\n(a) (b)\nFig. 13: H-E rain in Uttrakhand on 17 June 2013 at 0200 UTC (0730 IST) (a) without\nmodifications, (b) with modifications.\nThe Fig. 14 (a) show the weekly averaged 13-19 June 2013 district rain from modified\nH-E. The state averaged rain from H-E is 316 mm. The Fig. 14 (b) is weekly averaged\nrain map for the same week from IMD WWR, which shows a value of 322.9 mm for the\nstate of Uttrakhand. Thus, H-E with modifications provided in section 5.0 is able to give\na very close to realistic weekly rain values over Uttrakhand.\n16\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nState Average from modified H-E: 316 mm State Average from IMD WWR: 322 mm\n(a) (b)\nFig. 14: Averaged rain for a week from 13-19 June 2013 (a) district averaged from\nmodified H-E, (b) IMD Weekly Weather Report.\nThe other case of intense rain over Himalayan regions that is presented here is that of\nintense rain and floods in Jammu and Kashmir during 3-5 September 2014. Figure 15\n(a) shows the rain from INSAT-3D H-E on 04 September 2014 at 1500 hr without\napplying modifications. It can be observed that modified H-E is able to capture very\nintense rain in the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) region (Fig. 15 (b)), which otherwise it is\nnot able to capture in Fig. 15(a).\n(a) (b)\nFig. 15: Rain on 04 September 2014 at 1500 UTC from (a) without modification, and (b)\nwith modification.\nThe J&K state averaged H-E rain from modified algorithm for week from 3-10\nSeptember 2014 is found to be of 245.78 mm which is very close to the IMD WWR\nprovided rain of 267.7 mm. For the same week TRMM-3B42 V7 provides corresponding\nrain value of 95.33 mm. Thus the H-E rain from modified algorithm is better\nrepresentative of intense rain in J&K during 3-10 September 2014 then TRMM 3B42 V7.\n17\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nThe above two case studies of very intense rain over hilly terrain gives us confidence\nthat the modifications in H-E method as described in section 5.0, give more\nrepresentative rain values over Hilly terrain.\nFurther validations are carried out of the modified algorithm in different spatial and\ntemporal scales with IMD daily gridded, weekly met-subdivision averaged (from WWR)\nrain values, and also with TRMM 3B42 V7, which is an IR and microwave merged\nproduct.\nWe have computed the H-E rain from modified algorithm for 10 week period from 3 July\nto 10 September 2014. The rain values are averaged in met-subdivisions on weekly\nbasis and compared with rain values provided by IMD in WWR. A scatter plot of\ncomparison is shown in Fig. 16.\nFig. 16: Comparison of weekly meteorological subdivision averaged rain from H-E and\nIMD WWR for 10 weeks from 3 July to 10 September 2014.\nThe Fig. 16 when compared with Fig. 5 (a), shows a marked improvement in the\ncomparison of H-E rain with WWR rain values, both in terms of correlation as well as\nstandard deviation of their difference. This is despite of the fact that range of the rain\nvalues plotted in Fig. 16 is higher compared to that in Fig. 5 (a).\nThe Fig. 16 provides statistics of comparison for all the 10 weeks of comparison, the\nweek-by-week comparison statistics is provided in Table 3 below.\n18\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nTable 3: Week-by-Week comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision\naveraged H-E rain with IMD WWR.\nWeek ending on HE Vs IMD WWR\nR Err Bias\n9 July 2014 0.80 40.93 20.29\n16 July 2014 0.74 86.62 47.98\n23 July 2014 0.64 92.46 43.11\n30 July 2014 0.87 36.44 15.29\n06 Augt 2014 0.89 60.09 27.02\n13 Augt 2014 0.74 37.03 -2.88\n20 Augt 2014 0.81 49.74 18.37\n27 Augt 2014 0.81 47.38 24.96\n03 Sept 2014 0.72 58.64 19.92\n10 sep 2014 0.90 25.70 -1.44\nAll 10 weeks 0.78 46.64 21.26\nThe Table 3 shows a highest correlation between H-E rain WWR rain of 0.90 for a week\nfrom 4 to 10 September 2014 and lowest correlation of 0.64 for a week from 10 to 16\nJuly 2014. In order to see the comparison results in better perspectives, we have also\nused TRMM 3B42 V7 observations and compared their weekly met-subdivision\naveraged values with corresponding H-E and WWR rain values. This is shown in Table\n4 below.\nTable 4: Week-by-Week comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision\naveraged 3B42 V7 rain with IMD WWR and H-E rain.\nWeek ending on 3B42 vs WWR 3B42 Vs HE\nR Err Bias R Err Bias\n9 July 2014 0.53 57.24 0.32 0.49 70.94 -19.59\n16 July 2014 0.91 58.67 -18.63 0.91 81.48 -45.65\n23 July 2014 0.82 23.98 1.94 0.86 40.23 -18.35\n30 July 2014 0.61 45.63 -4.66 0.48 44.90 -3.22\n06 Augt 2014 0.52 50.53 -17.23 0.63 38.00 -14.34\n13 Augt 2014 0.92 49.09 1.66 0.86 68.90 -46.32\n20 Augt 2014 0.82 30.17 -7.46 0.87 53.34 -25.83\n27 Augt 2014 0.82 43.01 -5.20 0.61 97.40 -48.31\n03 Sept 2014 0.77 51.67 22.68 0.92 29.32 -2.28\n10 sep 2014 0.93 24.83 -8.11 0.88 39.21 -23.40\nAll 10 weeks 0.78 45.15 -3.47 0.76 60.19 -24.73\n19\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nIf we compare Table 3 and 4, we may conclude that overall (with all 10 weeks of\ndataset) correlation of WWR with H-E is same as that with TRMM 3B42 V7. The rms\ndifference of WWR with H-E is also very close to that with TRMM 3B42 V7. Despite of\nthese similarities, there is remarkable difference between these 2 comparisons, that is,\nthe correlation between H-E and WWR varies from moderate a range of 0.64 to 0.90,\nwhereas that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR varies from low value of 0.52 to high\nvalue of 0.93. Thus statistics between H-E and WWR is more stable compared to that\nbetween TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR. The comparison between TRMM 3B42 V7 and H-\nE is also attempted and is shown in the Table 4.\nIt may be recalled that 3B42 V7 is from state-of-art algorithm that combines IR and\nMicrowave Measurements and adjust the biases with surface observations. Despite of\nthese facts, H-E results are comparable (or even better) to that of 3B42 V7\nmeasurements. In order to see that how modified H-E measurements compare with only\nMicrowave measurements of precipitation, we compared 2 weeks (3 ‚Äì 16 July 2014) of\nweekly met-subdivisions averaged H-E rain with TRMM 3B41RT. The comparison\nresults are shown in Table 5 below. The comparison shows poorer correlation between\n3B41 and WWR that that between H-E and WWR. Thus, modified H-E rain is having a\nbetter representation of the surface observations than that by only microwave based\nrain rates from TRMM 3B41RT.\nTable 5: Week-by-Week comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision\naveraged rain from 3B41RT with H-E rain with WWR and IMD.\nWeek ending on 3B41 vs WWR 3B41 Vs HE\nR Err Bias R Err Bias\n9 July 2014 0.66 47.46 24.88 0.81 34.75 4.58\n16 July 2014 0.56 88.98 23.69 0.78 65.72 -24.29\nAll 2 weeks 0.58 71.31 24.28 0.80 52.56 -9.86\nWe are also obtained 0.25ox0.25o daily gridded surface rain measurements from IMD.\nBefore using them for further comparisons in finer spatial and temporal scales, we\nexamined their integrity vis-√†-vis rain values provided in WWR. We averaged gridded\nrain values and generated weekly rain maps similar to those provided in WWR. The\ncomparison statistics of IMD gridded dataset with WWR is provided in Table 6 below:\nTable 6: Comparison statistics of weekly meteorological subdivision averaged\n0.25ox0.25o daily gridded surface rain measurements from IMD with WWR.\nIMD daily grided data versus IMD Weekly Weather Report\nAll 10 Weeks R = 0.97 rmse = 16.36 Bias = -0.37\nWe expect a near perfect comparison between IMD gridded data and IMD WWR but\nthere exists marked difference between them.\n20\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nThe Table 3 shows the comparison between rain values from modified H-E and WWR,\nbut that does not give any indication of performance of H-E in different meteorological\nsub-divisions. In Table 7, we have made comparison in different subdivisions and\npresented the statics. Herein comparison over Lakshadweep is not provided as that is\nconsidered to represent maritime environment. It can be observed that high correlation\nexist in all the subdivisions except in Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura\n(NMMT) and Coastal AP, which needs further investigation. Similar comparison\nbetween 3B42 V7 and modified H-E is also attempted, which is shown in Table 8. From\nTable 8, it can be observed that the correlation of modified H-E rain with 3B42 V7 over\nNMMT and Coastal Andhra Pradesh (AP) is 0.32 and 0.64 which is not as poor as in\nTable 7. Thus any study to understand large difference in these two met subdivisions in\nTable 7 needs to take cognition of this fact that the 3B42 V7 and H-E are uniformly\nmeasured spatially averaged measurements. The coarser correlation as observed in\nTable 7 in NMMT and Coastal AP may be due to high variability of precipitation in these\nregions associated with geolocation error in the INSAT-3D observations (mean error of\n1-2 pixel error is possible) which may show poorer comparison with surface\nobservations taken at fixed locations (Piyush et al., 2012). Other than these two regions\nthe correlation between rain from modified H-E and WWR is reasonably good,\nespecially in the regions with high altitudes like J & K, Arunachal Pradesh, Uttrakhand\nand Himachal Pradesh, etc.\nTable 7: Comparison statistics of weekly averaged rain from H-E and WWR in each met\nsubdivisions.\nMet Sub Division R rmse bias Met Sub Division R rmse bias\nA & N 0.48 75.60 -55.50 West MP 0.63 74.80 -33.61\nArunachal Pradesh 0.73 63.23 -32.03 East MP 0.71 94.62 -58.28\nAssam & Megha. 0.69 49.90 -37.88 Guj, DNH & Dam. 0.76 40.61 10.15\nNMMT -0.07 61.06 -37.03 Saur., Katch & Diu 0.89 13.92 1.21\nSHWB 0.35 53.47 -0.99 Konkan & Goa 0.62 138.24 92.14\nGangetic WB 0.57 73.65 -17.54 Madhya Maha 0.81 69.72 -48.06\nOrissa 0.94 37.25 -30.85 Marathwada 0.71 64.50 -44.66\nJharkhand 0.75 67.34 -52.02 Vidarbh 0.86 44.42 -26.58\nBihar 0.94 29.23 -19.52 Chattisgarh 0.91 48.28 -33.79\nEast UP 0.89 39.61 -28.65 Coastal AP 0.22 41.64 -33.33\nWest UP 0.87 28.32 -20.28 Telengana 0.72 33.99 -23.12\nUttrakhand 0.84 43.35 -19.98 Rayalaseema 0.89 13.44 -10.87\nHR., Chd. & Delhi 0.61 16.55 -8.77 TN & Pondicherry 0.73 20.36 -16.96\nPunjab 0.97 10.42 -4.65 Coastal Karnataka 0.82 129.69 -60.61\nHP 0.72 34.71 -21.01 N.I.

In shorter measuring scales, it behaves as quasi-random\nstochastic process. Therefore, rain comparisons in shorter time scales and from\nobservations in different spatial scales lead to large errors (Piyush et al., 2012).\nNevertheless, we have compared daily 0.25ox0.25o averaged rain from modified H-E\nmethod with gridded dataset from IMD. The comparisons are carried out for each of the\nmet subdivisions as provided in Table 7 to table 9. The comparison statistics is provided\nin Table 10.\nThe Table 10 shows a reasonable good comparison statistics for different regions. If all\nregions are considered together, the comparison shows a correlation of 0.47 and rmse\nof 25.40 mm/day. In order to see this statistics in proper prospective, similar comparison\nstatistics of rain from TRMM 3B42 V7 and IMD gridded dataset is provided in Table 11,\nwhich show slightly improved correlation of 0.53 and rmse of 19.30 mm/day. The\ndifference may be due to geolocation error is INSAT-3D which is suspected to have\nmean error of 1-2 pixels in geolocation due to anomaly in the star sensor, which has\npotential to degrade statistics in smaller scales.\nTable 10: Comparison statistics of 0.25ox0.25o daily gridded rain from H-E and IMD in\neach met subdivisions.\nMet Sub Division R rmse bias Met Sub Division R rmse bias\nArunachal Pradesh 0.26 43.63 -5.87 East MP 0.45 3 0.11 -7.24\nAssam & Megha. 0.52 46.41 -3.34 Guj, DNH & Dam. 0.42 1 9.02 1 .66\nNMMT 0.17 28.77 -6.89 Saur., Katch & Diu 0.39 1 3.54 0 .43\nSHWB 0.22 38.85 0.84 Konkan & Goa 0.44 4 3.31 8 .26\nGangetic WB 0.41 23.45 -4.51 Madhya Maha 0.39 3 4.42 -7.83\nOrissa 0.51 31.85 -5.05 Marathwada 0.46 2 7.38 -6.36\nJharkhand 0.57 26.48 -8.14 Vidarbh 0.57 2 3.43 -3.93\nBihar 0.63 18.70 -2.30 Chattisgarh 0.61 2 6.18 -5.55\nEast UP 0.56 20.82 -4.61 Coastal AP 0.32 2 5.28 -4.64\nWest UP 0.45 16.03 -2.86 Telengana 0.40 1 8.04 -2.77\nUttrakhand 0.36 34.28 -3.33 Rayalaseema 0.51 9 .15 -1.17\nHR., Chd. & Delhi 0.39 10.43 -1.25 TN & Pondicherry 0.34 1 2.65 -2.46\n23\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nPunjab 0.45 9 .16 0.21 Coastal Karnataka 0.51 4 7.31 -3.04\nHP 0.30 31.83 -2.97 N.I.

This is mainly due to spatially averaged\nmeasurement of rain from H-E and TRMM TRMM-3B42 V7. The Table 12 also shows\nthe performance of modified H-E with respect to TRMM 3B42 V7 over oceans. It may be\nnoted here that neither IMD WWR nor gridded dataset has provides measurements\nover oceans. So the comparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 is the only source for accessing\nthe quality of H-E rain over oceans. It may be noted from Table 12 that daily 0.25ox0.25o\ngridded rain from H-E and 3B42 RT has a good agreement over oceans with correlation\nof 0.65 and rmse of 15.88 mm/day. If all area including land and oceans including and\nsurrounding India are taken into consideration, the correlation and rmse between H-E\nand TRMM-3B42 V7 is 0.59 and rmsd of 22.44 mm/day.\n24\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nTable 12: Comparison statistics of 0.25ox0.25o daily gridded rain from H-E and TRMM\n3B42 V7 in each met subdivisions.\nMet Sub Division R rmse bias Met Sub Division R rmse bias\nArunachal Pradesh 0.51 37.82 9.11 Guj, DNH & Dam. 0.58 2 0.43 -2.42\nAssam & Megha. 0.61 40.53 3.55 Saur., Katch & Diu 0.66 1 4.67 -2.04\nNMMT 0.39 25.09 4.31 Konkan & Goa 0.67 3 4.83 0 .68\nSHWB 0.37 34.26 2.61 Madhya Maha 0.71 2 6.84 5 .59\nGangetic WB 0.57 20.69 3.89 Marathwada 0.71 2 1.00 3 .29\nOrissa 0.57 30.05 4.69 Vidarbh 0.73 1 9.33 3 .05\nJharkhand 0.62 25.59 7.93 Chattisgarh 0.66 2 4.44 6 .25\nBihar 0.68 16.77 2.75 Coastal AP 0.53 2 2.76 3 .33\nEast UP 0.73 16.74 2.22 Telengana 0.55 1 5.78 2 .24\nWest UP 0.59 14.08 0.91 Rayalaseema 0.60 8 .27 0.32\nUttrakhand 0.50 31.89 4.83 TN & Pondicherry 0.48 1 1.47 1 .15\nHR., Chd. & Delhi 0.45 10.53 0.17 Coastal Karnataka 0.49 4 9.59 13.70\nPunjab 0.47 8 .46 -0.63 N.I.

The changes that are carried out in the modified algorithm\nare able to successfully represent the orographic rain which otherwise was not found to\nsuffer from huge errors. The rain is highly variable parameter over space and time and\nits validation in smaller scales always resulting large huge errors (Piyush et al., 2012).\nThe results presented above should be viewed with respect to validation comparison\nresults of the global standard rain products by other researchers. For example, in a\nrecent study by Tan et al. (2015) in which they evaluated six high resolution\nprecipitation products including TRMM-3B42 V7 over the Malaysia. They reported that\namong 5 satellite based rain products, the 3B42 V7 and is the best performing with\nrespect to surface observations, which on daily scale provides a correlation of 0.39 and\nrmse of 18.35 mm/day. While the India has much more diverse surface and climatic\nconditions with different cloud types and wide range of precipitation rates during S-W\nmonths, we achieve much higher correlation between modified H-E rain with surface\nobservations. A more important aspect of the rain from H-E vis-√†-vis TRMM 3B42 V7 is\ntimely availability of H-E product from IMD and MOSDAC sites. The TRMM 3B42 V7 is\navailable after latency of about 4 months, whereas INSAT-3D H-E is available within 15\n25\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\nminutes of data acquisition, which makes H-E very important for operational users,\nespecially those working with rain related natural disasters, nowcasting and numerical\nweather predictions.\nBased on above analysis, we can summarize the results as follows:\n1. H-E in the present form performs well over most parts of land and oceans but\nhas found to have weakness over high altitude regions.\n2. The weakness of the H-E in high altitude areas is successfully addressed in\nmodified H-E.\n3. On weekly and met-subdivision scale, the modified H-E provides a correlation of\n0.78 and rms difference of 46.64 mm with surface observations from IMD weekly\nWeather Report (WWR).\n4. On weekly and met-subdivision scale, the modified H-E provides a correlation of\n0.78 and rms difference of 45.15 mm with TRMM 3B42 V7.\n5. It is found that comparison statistics between modified H-E and WWR is\ncomparable to that between TRMM-3B42 V7 and WWR. However, week-by-\nweek variation in the comparison statistics of H-E versus WWR is more stable\nthan that between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR.\n6. Daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain from modified H-E matches well with surface\ngridded observations over land with correlation of 0.47 and rms difference of\n25.40 mm/day. Slightly higher correlation of 0.59 and rms of 22.40 difference\nmm/day is observed when H-E rain is compared with TRMM 3B42 V7. The\nresults are in tune with comparison between 3B42 V7 with surface observations.\n7. The comparison over oceans is not possible with IMD gridded surface\nobservations hence comparison is done with daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain for\nmodified H-E and TRMM 3B42 V7 and that show a correlation of 0.65 and rms\ndifference of 15.88 mm/h.\n8. The H-E rain shows a good comparison in all the met subdivisions except in\n‚ÄúNagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya and Tripura (NMMT)‚Äù and ‚ÄúCoastal Andhara\nPradesh‚Äù, which are also poorly comparable with TRMM 3B42 V7. The reason\nneeds to be further investigated.\n9. Over all, rain from modified H-E is comparable to TRMM 3B42 V7 with an\nadvantage of near real time availability of measurements (within 30 minutes)\ncompared to 4 months for the availability of TRMM 3B42 V7 product.\nThe modified H-E is soon going to be made operational both at SAC and MOSDAC\nsites. A ‚ÄúAlgorithm Theoretical Basis Document‚Äù is presently under preparation.\n8.0 Implementation Steps\nThe modified H-E is already implemented offline and running flawlessly. The present\noperational structure of H-E module comprising of two main programs called HEM and\nHEG. The HEM takes Earth elevation model (ETOPO2) as static data input and NCEP\nGFS model file as dynamic input and provides the correction files for equilibrium level,\n26\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\norography, TPW and RH. The HEM uses three separate programs as subroutines for\norographic correction, wind interpolation and a atmospheric thermodynamic model for\nthe calculation of LNB/EL. The HEG takes INSAT-3D level1 files as input along with\ncorrection files to produce the rain at every pixel within the study area. This is illustrated\nin flow chart 1 (Fig. 17). In the modified scheme, new HEM removes the program for\natmospheric thermo dynamics and includes the necessary model equations in the main\nbody of HEM itself. The modified HEM also takes histogram equalization matched up\nfiles for each of the height bins of the parameter (TPW/RH) at surface to given elevation\nbin as static input files. The only change in input to HEG is that in modified program for\nH-E rain, it also takes as input to Earth elevation model file (ETOPO2).This is shown in\nFig. 18.\nFig. 17: Flow chart showing present structure of H-E module.\nFig. 18: Flow chart showing modifiled structure of H-E module.\n27\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\n9.0 Domain and the format of output\nThe output is provided in terms of geolocation (latitude and longitude) and rain rate in\nmm/h.\nThe area of coverage is latitude: 30oE to 130o E, and longitude: 50o S to 50o N.\n10.0 Acknowledgement\nAuthors are thankful to Dr. Robert Koligowaski, NOAA/STAR for his unconditional\nsupport to develop H-E at SAC.\n28\nSAC/EPSA/AOSG/SR/04/2015\n11.0 References\nAnonymous, 2014, Tropical Cyclone Phailin ‚Äì Prediction, Monitoring and Analysis of\nAftereffects, Report # SAC/EPSA/SR-01/2014, Pub. by EPSA/SAC, ISRO,\nahmedabad, p 200.\nArkin, P A, A V R Krishna Rao, RR Kelker, 1986, Large scale precipitation and outgoing\nlongwave radiation from INSAT-1B during 1986 South-West Monsoon, Season,\nJournal of Climate, 2, 619-628.\nBarrett, E. c., and D.

Introduction\nAlgorithms is developed to map snow cover using INSAT 3D(R) Meteorological payload. The\nsnow mapping algorithm uses a grouped-criteria technique using the Normalized Difference Snow\nIndex (NDSI) and other spectral threshold tests to identify snow on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and to\nmap snow cover in dense forests. The NDSI is useful for snow mapping, as snow reflects strongly\nin the visible region but absorbs in the short-wave IR (SWIR) part of the spectrum. The reflectance\nof clouds is high in the visible as well as short-wave IR. This characteristic is used to identify and\nmap snow cover. Coarse resolution binary snow product from INSAT 3D imager will be further\nused to generate fractional snow cover product in synchronous with available high resolution snow\ncover products.\nValidation of the INSAT snow maps will be carried out using snow products of AWiFS data of\nResourcesat1/2 and a limited amount of field measurements. In addition, validation will also be\ncarried out using visual interpretation and the MODIS derived snow maps. The accuracy of the\nsnow maps may vary with land-cover type. Hence, the Snow map algorithm has been and will\ncontinue to be tested for a variety of land covers. Error estimates have been determined from field\nmeasurements for different land covers, and these errors are used to estimate the expected\nmaximum monthly and annual errors in Himalayan snow mapping using the algorithm.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 13\n1.2.1. Overview and background\nThe purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from\nINSAT 3D(R) data. This algorithm is based on the ratio techniques, which was used successfully\nto monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat-1. Daily snow and 10 days snow covered digital\nmap products will be generated.\nSnow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere winter.\nThis makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation balance (Foster\nand Chang, 1993). Large areas in the Himalayas are covered by snow during winter time. Area of\nsnow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can affect stream flow during spring\nand summer of the rivers originating in the Higher Himalayas. In addition, snow pack ablation is\nhighly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase in atmospheric temperature can influence snowmelt\nand stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni et al. 2002a). Therefore, mapping of areal extent and\nreflectance of snow is an important parameter for various climatological and hydrological\napplications. In addition, extent of snow cover can also be used as an input for avalanche\ninvestigation.\nSnow was first observed in April 1960 by TIROS-1 satellite in eastern Canada. Since then, the\npotential for operational satellite-based mapping has been enhanced by the development of higher\ntemporal-frequency and satellite sensors with higher spatial resolution. In addition, satellite\nsensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS have been used\nsuccessfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et al. 2006). This is possibly due to\ndistinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible and short wave infrared region.\nInformation generated from satellite observations has been extensively used for snowmelt runoff\nmodeling (Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing technique has been extensively used for snow\ncover monitoring in the Himalayan region with the help of numerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni\nand Rathore, 2003). Various analysis techniques as visual, hybrid (Visual and supervised\nclassification) have been used to estimate areal extent of snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003).\nHowever, major difficulty in snow cover monitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan\nregion is mountain shadow and confusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near\ninfrared region. Because of above-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual\ninterpretation technique is needed to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping\ncumbersome and time consuming. To overcome this problem normalized difference snow index\nmethod is developed and discussed in this document. In optical region snow reflectance is higher\nas compared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow\nreflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on satellite\nimages appears white in visible and black in SWIR region. This characteristic has been effectively\nused to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover mapping (Hall et al.\n1995).\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 14\n1.2.2. Remote Sensing of Snow Cover\nOne of the earliest methods used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation. During this\ninvestigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was carried out using band\n2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was extensively used for snow cover\nmonitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the Himalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2004).\nThis technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and\navailability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA satellite.\nIn this technique, a combination of visual and digital analysis was used. This was necessary\nbecause mountain shadows in the months from November to February normally make it difficult\nto use only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the month of March mountain\nshadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from supervised classification technique.\nThis technique has been extensively used to map snow cover in Western Himalaya, Baspa and\nSatluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003).\nAnother major difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is further compounded due to\nsimilar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The discrimination between snow and cloud\ncan be done by using various techniques such as textural analysis, association with shadow and by\nusing multi temporal analysis. In Himalayas and in present investigation, snow/cloud\ndiscrimination was done by using texture, where snow shows characteristic mountainous pattern,\nwhich cannot be seen when area is cloud covered. In visible and near infrared region reflectance\nof snow and cloud is very high. Therefore, discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible.\nThis is because of similar reflectance characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-\n1.75 ÔÅ≠m, 2.1-2.35 ÔÅ≠m and 3.55-3.93 ÔÅ≠m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In\nthese bands, snow has lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 ÔÅ≠m has\nbeen successfully used to separate certain types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et al. 2006).\nReflectance of fresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but\ndecreases in the near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren and\nWiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution becomes\nincorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance snowmelt (Clarke and\nNoone, 1985; Negi et al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and other factors (e.g. soot or\nvolcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over time. Fresh snow can have a\nreflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum) up to about 80 percent but its\nreflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow crystals metamorphose.\nSnow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance\nfrom snow is high in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow can\nbe nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular component\ncharacteristic of forward scattering increases.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 15\n1.2.3. Objective\nThe purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product from\nINSAT 3D(R) data. This algorithm is based on Normalised Difference Snow Index method, which\nwas used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat. Daily snow and\nmaximum 10-day snow covered area digital-map products will be generated.\nThis algorithm will be further modified, with NDVI adopted from other sources and infrared\nbrightness temperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively.\n1.3.

Algorithm Functional Specifications\n1.4.1. Overview\nA grouped-criteria technique incorporating NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the algorithm\nwas selected for the following reasons:\nÔÇ∑ Sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS, have been used for\ngenerating the snow products using similar algorithm. (Hall et al., 1995; Kulkarni et al., 2006;\nSingh et al., 2013; Rathore et al., 2015).\nÔÇ∑ The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar\nillumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as\nHimalayas (Kulkarni et al. 2006).\nÔÇ∑ INSAT 3D(R) Met payloads has a channel in 1.55 to 1.75 ÔÅ≠m with 1 km spatial resolution.\nSimilar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel number INSAT 3D(R)\n1&2 channels are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be generated at 1 km\nresolution.\nÔÇ∑ SWIR reflectance/Brightness temperature will be used to identify certain type of clouds which\nwere not separated using NDSI threshold. Threshold values will be fine-tuned. This will be\ninitially established using Spectral Reflectance library of Space Applications Centre and then\nsensitivity analysis of INSAT-3D(R) data.\nÔÇ∑ AWiFS derived snow cover products will be used to estimate snow part in synchronous INSAT\npixel to develop approach for estimating fractional snow cover product for INSAT data.\nIt runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward, computationally frugal,\nand thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the product is generated.\nSnow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The\nNormalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from many\nother surface features. Both sunlit and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A similar index\nfor vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been proven to be\neffective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year (Tucker, 1979 and 1986).\nAdditionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished using the NDSI.\nOther promising techniques, such as traditional supervised multispectral classifications, spectral-\nmixture modeling, or neural-network analyses have not yet been shown to be usable for automatic\napplication at the mountainous region. They are also computationally intensive. Training or the\ninteraction of an interpreter is required for successful application of techniques such as neural-\nnetwork analysis. These techniques may progress to regional applications and possibly even global\napplication in future years.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 17\nIn fractional snow cover, presently snow cover products derived using AWiFS data will be used to\ndevelop the approach. INSAT derived snow was matched with synchronous AWiFS snow pixels\nwhich was used to develop a relationship for snow fraction of INSAT pixel.\n1.4.2. Theoretical Background\n1.4.2.1. Snow cover map\nThe snow-cover mapping algorithm is designed to identify snow in each 1 km pixel. A regional,\ndaily snow product will be produced. A 10-day composite snow cover product will be generated\nby compositing successive days of snow cover products. This will yield maximum snow extent for\nthe 10-day period. If a pixel were snow covered on any orbit during that period, then that pixel\nwill be mapped as snow covered even if it were snow-free on all of the other orbits during the 10-\nday period. Other coverage and persistence statistics will also be included to assist analysis of the\ndata product.\nThere has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow maps\n(Kulkarni et al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the NOAA/NESDIS maps\nand the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer composition periods, e.g., 7 days\nto one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this period optimizes the ground coverage\nfrom the MODIS instrument. In India, the hydrological data analysis is carried out on 10-daily\nbasis; therefore 10-day composite will be prepared. If a researcher wants to produce a composite\nproduct for any period other than a 10-day period, from our daily product, this can be done using\nthe daily data.\n1.4.2.2. Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)\nThe NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus\nclouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance difference\nbetween the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is insensitive to a wide range\nof illumination conditions (Kulkarni et al. 2006). The NDSI is analogous to the normalized-\ndifference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986; Townshend and Tucker, 1984). NDSI\ncan be computed as given below;\nNDSI = (Visible - SWIR ) / (Visible + SWIR )\nINSAT B1 INSAT B2 INSAT B1 INSAT B2\nPixels that are approximately 75% or greater covered by snow were found to have NDSI values\nmore than 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi et al. 2006).\nThese NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous AWiFS scenes,\ncomparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. (Kulkarni et al, 2004).\nPure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are mixed in a pixel. Snow in\nmixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure snow can be distinguished by\nits high NDSI value (Negi et al. 2006). Since bandwidth of AWiFS band 1 and INSAT 3D(R)\nimager is different, initially NDSI threshold value will be established using Field Spectral Data\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 18\nLibrary of Space Applications Centre (Singh et al. 2005 and Negi et al. 2006). This will be further\nevaluated during post launch period, by carrying out sensitivity analysis (Kulkarni et al. 2006).\nIn forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly classify\nthese forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (Negi et al. 2006). NDVI and\nNDSI will be used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and snow covered forests.\nForested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested pixels. Thus by using the\nNDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI threshold in forested areas\nwithout compromising the algorithm performance for other land covers. Since appropriate bands\nare not available in INSAT 3D(R) payload, mask will be used from other existing source.\nSince water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to separate water\nfrom snow.\n1.4.2.3. Snow / Cloud Discrimination\nSnow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow\nreflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by their\ngenerally high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic spectrum\n(Kulkarni et al. 2002a), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave infrared part of\nthe spectrum.\nWhile the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify or\ndiscriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data show\nthat NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. Cirrus clouds have high\nreflectance in SWIR region than snow which requires fine tuning of threshold value and will be\nused as an additional criterion in present approach. This algorithm will further be improved due to\navailability of thermal bands in INSAT 3D(R) Met payload. Appropriate brightness temperature\nthreshold will be used to separate cloud from snow (Romanov and Tarpley, 2003) or cloud removal\nwill also be tested using cloud mask product subject to its availability as an additional INSAT\n3D(R) derived product. This will be additional criteria than in built criteria of NDSI.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 19\n1.4.2.4.

Sensitivity analysis to establish NDSI threshold\nIn order to establish credible threshold value of NDSI for snow cover mapping, sensitivity tests of\nindividual threshold values were carried out. Sensitivity analysis will be carry out to identify NDSI\nthreshold for INSAT 3D(R) snow products. This threshold value will also be verified using FFC\ncombination for snow covered area identification.\n1.4.2.6. Fraction Snow Cover\nSnow binary product of INSAT 3D data, available at coarse resolution, will be used to convert into\nfractional snow cover which will be helpful to improve the snow cover areal extent based on\noccupancy of that pixel in terms of actual snow fraction present in respective pixel of INSAT 3D.\nSynchronous INSAT and high resolution satellite derive NDSI and snow cover product were\nselected for the winter season. Different months and terrain in Himalayan region was chosen to\nrepresent to take care possible scenarios. INSAT derived NDSI and snow pixel was compared with\nNDSI and snow pixel for high resolution data to develop a relationship between NDSI and snow\ncover areal extent for coarse and fine resolution datasets. This develop relationship will be used to\ngenerate fractional snow cover area for INSAT dataset and will be helpful to improve daily snow\ncover areal extent from geostationary platform.\n1.4.3. Operational Implementation\nStep 1 : Conversion from gray count to Reflectance and BT:\nIn this step, the DN values will be converted into Radiance, Reflectance and Brightness\ntemperature using calibration coefficient available with INSAT 3D(R) data. The radiometrically\nprocessed data will also be geolocated and this will provide a radiometrically and geometrically\ncorrected product to be used further in algorithm.\nStep 2 : Cloud elimination\nThis step includes the cloud screening from the INSAT 3D(R) image. Cloud screening is based on\nSWIR reflectance/temperature data, or cloud mask product will be used subject to its availability,\nand this will help to clear cloudy pixels.\nStep 3 : Generation of NDSI image\nNormalized Difference Snow Index will be computed using the normalized ratio of visible and\nSWIR channel as given below;\nNDSI = (R ‚Äì R ) / (R ‚Äì R )\nINSAT B1 INSAT B2 INSAT B1 INSAT B2\nwhere R is the reflectance of the respective channel.\nStep 4: Generation of Fractional snow pixel\nA developed relationship will be used to convert INSAT 3D coarse resolution pixel into fractional\nsnow cover pixel for the respective pixel.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 21\nAccuracy of SCM and FSC is expected to be approximately 90% or better.\n1.5.

Visual Snow Cover Map\nSnow cover pixel will be identified visually and will be verified on automated snow cover product\ngenerated using INSAT 3D(R). This may also be extended to visually map snow covers and\nvalidate these map with operationally derive snow cover products.\n1.6.3. Comparison of INSAT 3D(R) snow maps with AWiFS snow products\nINSAT-derived snow maps will continue to be compared with snow cover maps generated by\nAWiFS. In addition, comparisons will be made between MODIS maps. Comparison of Snowmap\nresults with these independently produced snow data sets will allow errors to be identified that will\npermit us to determine the accuracy of the global maps relative to one another.\n1.7. Future Scope\nThis algorithm will be further modified, in conjunction with NDVI (available from AWiFS product\nor any other source) and infrared brightness temperature to identify snow in forest covers and\nidentify cloud pixels, respectively. INSAT 3D being a coarse resolution satellite, Approach using\nAWiFS snow products has been developed, however scatterplot shows a spread over different\nrange which could be due to geolocation error. An attempt will also be made using different\ntechniques such as homogeneity test, histogram matching etc. to reduce the scatter due to mismatch\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 22\nprobably arising due to geolocation error. This will further help to improve fractional snow cover\nproduct to improve the accuracy of snow cover areal extent.\nReferences\nClarke, A.D. and K.J. Noone, 1985.

Algorithm Specification\nVersion Date Modified by Description\n1.0 June 2018 C. P. Singh Biomass Burning Emission Product\n2.2. Introduction\nNear-real-time estimates of biomass burning emissions are crucial for air quality monitoring. This\nalgorithm theoretical basis document (ATBD) provides a description of new fire characterization\nscience product, specifically named as, biomass burning emission product (BBEP) utilizing the\nINSAT-3D/3DR Imager. The INSAT active fire algorithm is a dynamic multispectral thresholding\ncontextual algorithm that is based on the sensitivity of the 3.9 Œºm (MIR channel) to high\ntemperature sub-pixel anomalies relative to the less sensitive 10.8 Œºm (TIR-1 Channel). The\ncurrent operational version of the INSAT fire product provides information on the location of the\nfire pixel only. In order to characterize the fire in terms of BBEP further details like estimates of\ninstantaneous sub-pixel fire size, temperature, and radiative power; ecosystem type; and a\nclassification flag needs to be worked out at pixel level. The fire properties are coupled to each\nother, one cannot calculate an instantaneous fire size without estimating a fire temperature, and\nfire radiative power (FRP) is a function of size and temperature. The algorithm will work upon\naccurate estimation of satellite-derived fire radiative power (FRP) for individual fire pixels. The\nINSAT-3D/3DR satellites observe wildfires at an interval of 15‚Äì30 min. Because of the impacts\nfrom sensor saturation, thin cloud cover, and background surface, the FRP values will not be\ncontinuously observed. The missing observations will be simulated by combining the available\ninstantaneous FRP observations within a day and a set of representative climatological diurnal\npatterns of FRP for various ecosystems (evergreen forests, semi-evergreen and deciduous forests\nwith their densities like dense, medium and open forests). Finally, the simulated diurnal variation\nin FRP will be applied to quantify biomass combustion and emissions in individual fire pixels with\na latency of 1 day (0300 UTC ‚Äì 0230 UTC for INSAt-3D & 0315 UTC to 0245 UTC for 3DR;\nfollowing day). It is expected that near-real-time hourly emissions from BBEP would provide a\ncrucial component for atmospheric and chemical transport modelers to forecast air quality and\nweather conditions.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 26\n2.3. Algorithm Overview\nBiomass burning emissions can be modeled using four fundamental parameters; burned area, fuel\nloading (biomass density), the fraction of biomass combustion, and the factors of emissions for\ntrace gases and aerosols. By integrating these parameters, biomass burning emissions can be\nestimated using the following formula (Seiler and Crutzen, 1980):\nE = DM * F = A * B * C * F ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.(1)\nWhere, E = emissions from biomass burning (kg);\nDM = dry fuel mass combusted (kg);\nF = factor of consumed biomass that is released as trace gases and smoke particulates\nA = burned area (km2);\nB = biomass density (kg/km2);\nC = fraction of biomass consumed during a fire event.\nThis simple model has been widely applied to estimate fire emissions in local, regional, and global\nscales (Ito and Penner, 2004; Reid et al., 2004; Wiedinmyer et al., 2006; van der Werf et al., 2006;\nZhang et al., 2008). The accuracy of the emissions depends strongly on the quality of fuel loading\nand burned area estimates, which have high uncertainties (Zhang et al., 2008; van der Werf et al.,\n2010; French et al., 2011). Alternatively, Wooster, 2002 demonstrated a linear relationship between\nfuel consumption and total emitted fire radiative energy. This is due to the fact that the total amount\nof energy released per unit mass of dry fuel fully burned is weakly dependent on vegetation types\nand fuel types, which ranges between 16 and 22 MJ/kg (Lobert and Warnatz, 1993; Whelan, 1995;\nTrollope et al., 1996; Wooster et al., 2005). Thus, biomass burning emission is linearly linked to\nfire radiative energy in a simple formula (Wooster, 2002):\n‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..(2)\nWhere; FRP = fire radiative power (MW);\nFRE = fire radiative energy (MJ);\nt and t = beginning and ending time (second) of a fire event;\n1 2\nŒ≤ = biomass combustion rate (kg/MJ)\nF = emission factor (g/kg for CO and PM2.5)\nFRE represents the combination of total burned area and the dry fuel mass combusted (e.g., live\nfoliage, branches, dead leaf litter, and woody materials) in a given time period, which reduces error\nsources of parameter measurements comparing with the first approach (eq.1) employing both\nburned area and fuel loading in the estimates of biomass burning emissions. Thus, the FRP\napproach will be better to produce BBEP.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 27\n2.3.1 Algorithm flowchart (FRP approach)\nOnce a fire is identified, Fire Radiative Power (FRP) estimation algorithm will be applied. FRP is\ntheoretically a function of fire size and fire temperature. It is empirically related to the difference\nof brightness temperature between a fire pixel and ambient background pixels at the middle\ninfrared (MIR) band (Kaufman et al., 1998). Further, FRP is approximated as the difference of\nMIR spectral radiances between a fire pixel and ambient background pixels in a linear form\n(Wooster et al., 2003). The proposed method is based on the assumption that Fire Radiative Power\n(FRP) is empirically related to the difference of brightness temperature between a fire pixel and\nambient background pixels at the middle infrared (MIR) channel. Biomass burning emission will\nbe computed using eq.2 (Wooster, 2002) below:\n\u0000\u0000\nE = ‚à´ FRP x √ü x F\ndt\n\u0000\u0000\nŒ≤ is biomass combustion rate (kg/MJ) which is assumed to be a constant. It is 0.368 ¬±0.015 kg/MJ\nbased on field controlled experiments regardless of the land surface conditions (Wooster et al.,\n2005). This coefficient has been accepted for the calculation of biomass burning emissions from\nMODIS FRP, SEVERI FRP and GOES FRP (Roberts et al., 2009; Ellicott et al., 2009, Zhang et\nal., 2012), and so this value will be adopted.\nF is emission factor (a representative value that is used to represent the quantity of a trace gas or\naerosol species released into the atmosphere during a forest fire activity. The value is a function of\nfuel type and is expressed as the number of kilograms of particulate per ton (or metric ton) of\nmaterial or fuel. The value for F will be assigned for each emitted species (CO and PM2.5) with\nland cover type according to values published in literature (Andreae and Merlet, 2001; Wiedinmyer\net al., 2006). Specifically, the emission factors will be assigned to stratified land cover types: e.g.\n11.07 g/kg (PM2.5) and 77 g/kg (CO) in forests, 5.6 g/kg (PM2.5) and 84 g/kg (CO) in shrublands,\n9.5 g/kg (PM2.5) and 90 g/kg (CO) in grasslands, and 5.7 g/kg (PM2.5) and 70 g/kg (CO) in\ncroplands.\nAlthough INSAT-3D/R satellites observe the surface every 15‚Äì30 min, observations of diurnal\nfires may, to a great extent, be obstructed by the impact factors including cloud cover, canopy\ncover, heavy fire smoke, heterogeneity of the surface, large pixel size and view angle of satellites,\nand weak energy release from fire pixels (Giglio et al., 2003; Prins and Menzel, 1992; Roberts et\nal., 2005; Zhang et al., 2011). Thus, missing FRP observations cause a great amount of gaps in the\nspatial and temporal distributions. As a result, FRE in a given time period and region is not able to\nbe directly integrated from satellite-observed FRP. To overcome these limitations, the diurnal\npatterns of FRP need to be reconstructed, which will be done by using a climatological value of\nFRP between t and t as exemplified in fig.1. Since, we will be giving products only over forests\n1 2\ntherefore, different forest density classes and forest types will be considered for making efforts in\nsimulating diurnal FRP climatology.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 28\nFig.1. Climatological diurnal FRP (average data from 2002 to 2005) for various ecosystems in\nNorth America (Zhang et al., 2012)\nTo do this, we will adopt the approach that was originally developed to reconstruct diurnal pattern\nof fire size (Zhang and Kondragunta, 2008; Zhang et al., 2011). The climatological FRP will be\ncalculated for forest types and their density classes, separately. These FRP data in a half-hourly\ninterval will be smoothed using statistical fittings. The offset of shift is determined from the data\npairs of the detected FRP for the given fire pixel and the corresponding values in the climatological\ncurve using a least square method. Because fires in a pixel may not last for a very long time and\ninstantaneous fires are not continuously detected due to the impacts from cloud cover, smoke, low\nseverity fires releasing limited fire energy, and other factors (Zhang et al., 2011), the fire duration\nwill be determined by assuming that fire could be extended 2 hours prior and post instantaneous\nfire detections if the number of the fire detections within a day is more than three times for the\nsame pixel. Otherwise, fire occurrences are based on actual satellite detections. Finally, total FRE\nwill be computed which is the time integral of fire radiative power (FRP) and FRE has correlation\nbetween PM 2.5 concentrations and other emissions.\n‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..(3)\nwhere t is the start time of a fire event and t is the end time of the fire pixel.\ns e\nFor a given material one may assert that the total FRE of a fire is directly related to mass consumed\nby that material‚Äôs heat of combustion, which can then be related to PM 2.5 and other emissions\n(Kaufman et al., 1998; Wooster et al., 2003; Roberts et al., 2005).\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 29\nBecause the temporal resolution of INSAT-3D/3DR will range from 15 (together) to 30 min\n(alone), we will set a minimum time step as 30 min. This means that we will calculate FRE by\nassuming that a fire can last for at least a half hour if there is one FRP observation. The half-hourly\nFRE is binned to calculate hourly biomass burning emissions.\nIn near-real-time monitoring of biomass burning emissions, we will use INSAT-3D/3DR fire\nproducts from MMDRPS. The diurnal pattern of FRP will then be simulated for the previous day\n(0300 UTC ‚Äì 0230 UTC for INSAT-3D & 0315UTC to 0245UTC for INSAT-3DR) for estimating\nfire emissions. As a result, the BBEP will be produced with a latency of 1 day. Daily and monthly\nemissions can be given as the sum of hourly values for a given region and an ecosystem type,\nseparately.\n2.3.2 Domain of operation\nThe domain of application will be kept to 10¬∞ - 45¬∞N, 45¬∞ - 105¬∞E (covering SAARC countries,\npresently operational Asia_Mer Sector) and only to forest regions.\n2.3.3 Global scenario\nFRP approach is adapted by WF_ABBA in the Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite\nStudies (CIMSS), University of Wisconsin [Prins et al., 1998; Weaver et al., 2004]. Particularly,\nthe WF_ABBA V65 detects instantaneous fires in subpixels using infrared bands around 3.9 and\n10.7 mm from a network of geostationary satellite instruments that include SEVIRI on board the\nMeteosat-9, and Imagers on board both GOES and MTSAT. It then derives instantaneous FRP\nfrom radiances in single MIR [Wooster et al., 2003]. Further, to minimize false fire detections, the\nWF_ABBA uses a temporal filter to exclude the fire pixels that are only detected once within the\npast 12 h [Schmidt and Prins, 2003]. The WF_ABBA V65 has been installed in NOAA OSDPD\n(the Office of Satellite Data Processing and Distribution) to operationally produce FRP from\ngeostationary satellites since late 2009 (http://satepsanone.nesdis.noaa.gov/pub/FIRE/forPo/). The\nNOAA fire product provides detailed information of WF_ABBA V65 fire detections.\n2.4. Assumptions and Limitations\nSeveral assumptions have been made concerning performance estimates. Meteorological satellite\ninstruments are not inherently designed to be able to detect and characterize small sub-pixel hot\nspots. Therefore, performance of the algorithm will be sensitive to instrument noise and other\nanomalies. First of all, the output from the equations is no better than the input Imager data. The\ntechnique assumes well calibrated Channels that meet current specifications for NedT, co-\nregistration, diffraction, earth location, saturation, etc. It also assumes that sub-pixel detector\nsaturations are flagged and available for application in near real time. If this information is not\navailable, sub-pixel characterization is suspect for both saturated and non-saturated fire pixels. The\nalgorithm assumes that observed radiances are determined by the fire and non-fire portion of the\npixel and are only affected by and adjusted for surface emissivity, water vapor attenuation, semi-\ntransparent clouds/smoke, diffraction, and solar reflectivity (3.9 ¬µm band ‚Äì Channel 3 ‚Äì only).\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 30\nEach of the above ‚Äúattenuation‚Äù (except clouds/smoke) properties are assumed the same for the\nfire pixel and background conditions.\n2.5. Validation\nHigh uncertainty exists in global biomass emissions and accurate validation is currently not\npossible because of the lack of reliable in situ measurement. Therefore, BBEP will be compared\nwith other data sources. We will validate our product with the Global Fire Emissions Database\n(GFED), Quick Fire Emission Data (QFED), SEVIRI, Himawari & FY-4A and MODIS products.\nValidation using in-situ measurement using portable instruments will also be attempted.\nReferences\nAndreae, M.

Introduction\nLand surface albedo, defined as the fraction of incident solar radiation (0.3‚Äì4.0 um) reflected by\nland surfaces (Dickinson, 1995; Liang, 2004) is one of the most important parameters in general\ncirculation models, hydrology models, numerical weather models, and surface radiation-\nbudget studies. Land surface albedo (LSA) is a key geophysical parameter controlling the energy\nbudget in land‚Äìatmosphere interactions (Dickinson, 1983). LSA varies spatially and evolves\nseasonally based on solar illumination conditions, rainfall, soil moisture, vegetation growth, snow\naccumulation/melting and anthropogenic activities. Satellite remote sensing can provide a vantage\npoint for estimating land surface albedo at various spectral, spatial, temporal, and angular\nresolutions. During the last few decades, many satellite-generated albedo products have been\nderived with varying spatial resolution of 500 m to 20 km. Many researchers across the globe have\ndeveloped algorithms for various sensors to derive albedo directly from satellite observations. The\nAVHRR algorithm provides global coverage of albedo products (Strugnell & Lucht, 2001).\nPOLDER and MISR allow researchers to use multi-angular information to obtain a better\nunderstanding of surface reflectance anisotropy (Diner et al., 1999; Leroy et al., 1997). The\nModerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) albedo product (Schaaf et al.,\n2002) utilizes multiple spectral bands to derive accurate broadband albedo estimations at both\nhigh spatial and high temporal resolutions. Clouds and the Earth‚Äôs Radiant Energy System\n(CERES) uses broad shortwave band to derive the planetary albedo (Rutan et al., 2006). With the\ndevelopment and availability of geostationary satellite sensors, many researchers have focused on\nderiving the diurnal changes of surface albedo based on a much wider range of solar\nillumination angles, such as the Meteosat/SEVIRI albedo product (Geiger et al., 2008; Pinty et al.,\n2000).\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 35\n3.3. Theoretical background\nThe conventional methods for estimating broadband albedos rely on a series of steps in the\nprocessing chain, including atmospheric correction, surface angular modelling, and narrowband-\nto-broadband albedo conversions. Unfortunately, errors associated with each procedure may be\naccumulated and significantly impact the accuracy of the final albedo products (Liang, 2003).\nUncertainties associated with each procedure may be accumulate and may have bearing on final\noutput.\nAn alternative scheme developed in the earlier studies (Liang et al., 1999, 2003) linked TOA (top-\nof-atmosphere) narrowband albedos with three land surface broadband albedos using a\nfeedforward neural network without performing any atmospheric corrections. This idea stems\nfrom earlier study (Pinker et al., 1985) that linearly related TOA and surface broadband albedos.\nSurface broadband albedo depends on surface spectral reflectance as well as atmospheric\nconditions. TOA observations contain information on both surface reflectance and atmospheric\noptical properties, which implies that it is possible for us to compute the broadband albedos using\nTOA narrowband albedos without performing any atmospheric corrections.\nLiang et al. (1999) used the MODTRAN model to simulate TOA reflectances under the\nLambertian assumption, and they obtained a relationship between MODIS TOA reflectances and\nbroadband albedos by using a neural network method. Liang et al. (2003) used the projection\npursuit regression method. However, these two studies did not consider the anisotropy of\nthe land surface. Liang et al. (2005) further improved it for estimating daily land surface albedo of\nthe Greenland ice sheet from MODIS data. They used the discrete ordinates radiative transfer\nprogram for a multilayered plane parallel medium to simulate TOA reflectances of snow/ice\nand then developed the relationship between bidirectional TOA reflectances and broadband\nalbedos using an empirical training method; they divided the solar/view geometry space into\nangular bins and calculated the regression coefficients of each angular bin using a linear regression\nmethod. Qu et al. (2015) have provided detailed review of algorithms for albedo.\nHere, we propose to develop a direct-estimation algorithm by employing an atmospheric\nradiative transfer code to simulate the TOA directional reflectances in the two spectral bands of\nINSAT-3D Imager located in visible (0.55-0.75 um) and shortwave infrared- SWIR (1.55-1.70\num) wavelengths and also calculate the broadband reflectance in the shortwave band (0.4-2.5 um),\nand then establishing a relationship between the TOA reflectances and the broadband\nreflectance using the regression method, which would yield narrow to broadband conversion\ncoefficients.\nAn approach for estimating land surface broadband albedo from multispectral remote sensing\nobservations is a hybrid approach that combines extensive radiative transfer simulations\n(physical) with regression methods (statistical). It directly links the TOA radiance or reflectance\nto surface broadband albedo without performing different processes as per the first approach. Here\nnarrowband-to-broadband spectral conversion by considering the spectral response function of\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 36\nthe sensor in various spectral bands of the instrument is the main step required to derive the\nalbedo. Figure 1 shows the spectral signatures of major surfaces with the relative spectral\nresponse (RSR) of INSAT-3D Imager instrument. A weighting factors (Narrow to broad band\nconversion coefficients) are to be determined with the radiative transfer simulations. This\napproach has been successfully used to estimate broadband albedo from MODIS data (Liang\net al., 2003).\nFigure 1. A typical spectral distribution of the reflectances for vegetation, soil, snow over shortwave solar\nspectrum range shown with the RSR of two spectral bands: visible (solid line) and SWIR (dashed line) of\nINSAT-3D Imager instrument.\n3.4. Methodology\nIn the present study, the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) is not taken into\nconsideration and the surface is assumed to reflect isotropically (i.e. equally at all angles), so this\nalbedo is referred to as the \"diffuse albedo\" or the \"hemispherical albedo\". When the land surface\nis assumed as lambertian (the reflectance is isotropic from different solar/view angles), the value\nof Bidirectional Reflectance Factor (BRF) is then equal to the albedo and the surface broadband\nalbedo can be estimated from linear combinations of narrowband albedo (spectral directional\nreflectance) with different weight coefficients. This method was first proposed by Brest and\nGoward (1987) and was then applied to different sensors: AVHRR (Saunders, 1990; Russell et al,\n1997), Landsat TM (Duguay & Ledrew, 1992; Knap et al, 1999), Meteosat (Valiente et al., 1995)\nand Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) (Liang, 2003). Liang (2001) reviewed the\nabove studies and provided simple conversion coefficients for estimating broadband surface\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 37\nalbedo from a variety of sensors under different atmospheric and surface conditions. The\nvalidation results show that the conversion formulae are very accurate with an average residual\nstandard error around 0.02 (Liang et al., 2003).\nFigure 2. Algorithm flowchart for direct-retrieval of the broadband albedo from the INSAT-3D Imager\ndata by generating narrow to broadband conversion coefficients\nFor the retrieval of broadband albedo in the present study, the basic procedure consists of three\nmajor steps as illustrated in figure 2. The first step is to conduct extensive radiative transfer\nsimulations using the 6SV code, the second step is to obtain the narrow to broad band conversion\ncoefficients by linking the simulated TOA reflectance with surface broadband reflectance using\nlinear regression analysis and third step is to apply the narrow to broadband conversion coefficients\non the INSAT-3D Imager data to obtain the broadband albedo. Various surface reflectance spectra\nof different cover types with different atmosphe ric conditions have been incorporated into\nthe radiative transfer simulations. In this study, attempt has been made to estimate land surface\nbroadband albedos using TOA directional reflectance, instead of TOA spectral albedos. This\nimprovement has in fact greatly simplified this method, since calculating TOA spectral albedo\nrequires TOA angular modelling that might introduce large errors.\n3.4.1. Radiative transfer simulations\nFor a given atmospheric and surface condition, we need to compute the directional\nreflectance at the top of the atmosphere. Assuming the surface is Lambertian, the upw elling\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 38\nradiance at the TOA can be computed by radiative transfer simulations through 6SV (Second\nSimulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum ‚Äì Vector version) code (Vermote et al.,\n1997). It is critical to use the representative surface reflectance spectra in data simulations.\nDifferent surface reflectance spectra covering the spectral range 0.4‚Äì2.5 um representing\nvegetation, sand, water, snow surfaces were interpolated in the study. The simulation outputs\ninclude total shortwave albedo and spectral albedos that are calculated by incorporating the sensor\nspectral response functions.\nIn the 6SV simulations, varying aerosol optical thickness values corresponding to lower to\nhigher aerosol loadings, continental aerosol model, and tropical atmospheric profile that also\nrepresent different water vapor and other gaseous amounts and profiles. The aerosol model used\nare the defaults in 6SV and atmospheric profiles over Indian region were used in the simulations.\nFor the operational application of this method, more should perhaps be included to represent the\nvariable atmospheric conditions. The upwelling TOA radiance (LÔÅ¨) is further normalized to\napparent spectral reflectance (ÔÅ≤aÔÉô) using the expression,\nWhere, d is the Sun-Earth distance in Astronomical Units, E0 is exo-atmospheric solar\nirradiance and ÔÅ±s is the sun zenith angle. Land surface broadband albedo is defined as the ratio\nof the surface upwelling flux (Fu) to the downward flux (Fd) (Liang, 2003),\nwhere ÔÉô is denoted to the waveband from wavelength ÔÅ¨1 to wavelength ÔÅ¨2ÔÄÆÔÄ†ÔÉôÔÄ†ÔÉéÔÄ†ÔÄ®ÔÅ¨ÔÄ±ÔÄ¨ÔÄ†ÔÅ¨ÔÄ≤ÔÄ©ÔÄÆ If\nÔÉôÔÄ†ÔÉéÔÄ†ÔÄ†ÔÄ®ÔÄ∞ÔÄÆÔÄ≤ÔÄµÔÄ¨ÔÄ†ÔÄ¥ÔÅµÔÅ≠ÔÄ© albedo is the total shortwave broadband albedo. The wave range ÔÉôÔÄ†ÔÄ†ÔÉé (0.4,\n0.ÔÄ∑ÔÅµÔÅ≠ÔÄ©ÔÄ† and ÔÉôÔÄ†ÔÄ†ÔÉé (0.7, 4um) correspond to visible and near-infrared (near-IR) albedos,\nrespectively. ÔÅ≤ÔÄ®ÔÅ¨ÔÄ© is the surface spectral reflectance spectra. One of the major limitations in this\nsimulation study is its assumption of Lambertian surfaces. The major reason is that we do not have\na good understanding of the directional reflectance properties of various surface types at the\nINSAT-3D Imager resolution.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 39\n3.4.2. Generation of narrow to broadband albedo conversion coefficients\nOnce the database is created from the simulations described above, the next step is to link TOA\nreflectance to land surface broadband albedos. This exercise is to be carried out for each of the\nmajor land cover types. We used regression analysis to establish the linear relationship (equation\n4) between TOA reflectance in two bands of INSAT-3D Imager and LSA and to obtain the arrow\nto broadband (NtoB) conversion coefficients C0, C1, and C2.\nWhereÔÄ†ÔÅ° is the broadband LSA, while ÔÅ≤3D-VIS and ÔÅ≤3D-SWIR are the TOA reflectances in\nvisible and SWIR bands of INSAT-3D Imager sensor respectively. A set of NtoB coefficients\nare computed for four major land covers namely, soil, vegetation, water and snow. The physical\nmeaning of the conversion factors C and C is obvious from equation (4). They quantify the ratio\n1 2\nof the reflected radiances within the narrow bands to the reflected radiances for the visible and\nSWIR broad bands, or the degree of the representativeness of the narrowband reflectance for the\nbroadband reflectance. The conversion coefficients developed from extensive radiative transfer\nsimulations are then would be applied to the INSAT-3D Imager TOA reflectance data.\n3.4.3. Calibration of the TOA observations of INSAT-3D Imager sensor\nIt has been observed that the satellite-level signal in two spectral bands of the INSAT-3D\nImager instrument significantly underestimate the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance values. This\nfactor severely modulates the LSA computations. An exercise was carried out to compensate\nthis factor of underestimation from a systematic comparison between TOA radiances of\nINSAT-3D Imager and INSAT-3A CCD and MODIS sensors. After introducing the radiance\ncalibration coefficients equation (4) can be rewritten as,\nWhere ÔÅ¢1 and ÔÅ¢2 are radiance calibration coefficients of INSAT-3D Imager instrument.\nAssuming the multiplication of two coefficients ÔÅ¢1 and C1 as new coefficient ÔÅ°1, ÔÅ¢2 and C2 as\nÔÅ°2 and C0 as ÔÅ°0, equation (5) can be rewritten as,\n3.4.4. Data used and generation of LSA\nRaw digital number data of visible and SWIR bands of INSAT-3D Imager sensor corresponding\nto 10:30 hrs of 1st of each month of year 2015 was downloaded from the MOSDAC server. The\ndigital number data were converted to the TOA radiances, which was subsequently converted to\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 40\nthe TOA reflectances using equation (1). A cloud mask was devised from two sources, (a)\nthresholds of INSAT-3D Imager data and (b) MODIS cloud mask. A cloud-free TOA reflectance\ndata was then converted to the LSA using the N to B coefficients generated from the simulation\nexercise as discussed in previous section. A land over product available from the MODIS sensor\nwas used as a reference for applying land cover-based N to B coefficients.\n3.5. Results\nMonthly broadband LSA maps were derived from the INSAT-3D Imager data representing 1st day\nof each month of the year 2015 using the method discussed in the above section. The broadband\nLSA was derived at a spatial resolution of 4 km over India and surrounding region. The broadband\nLSA maps for different months are shown in the figure 3. Visually the spatial patterns and\nmagnitudes of broadband albedo look very reasonable. Majority of the broadband albedo values\nare in the range of 0.1 to 0.3 representing vegetation and soil pixels. However, desert regions show\nLSA value greater than 0.3 and ranged between 0.3 to 0.5. While snow covered regions show LSA\nvalue greater than 0.4 or 0.5. An error due to clouds still persists even though the cloud mask was\napplied on the images. Fringe of clouds are seen with very high albedo values, which causes an\nerroneous albedo value. A better mechanism for removing clouds has to be developed in future.\nThe assumption of a Lambertian surface is being debated (Liang et al., 2003). The key\nargument is that the broadband albedo depends on both spectral and angular properties of the land\nsurface. From the validation analysis of the study by Liang et al. (2003), it appeared that an\nassumption of spectral information dominance over the angular information does not lead to\nsignificant errors, which is an important achievement of this study. Overall it can be said that\nbroadband LSA could be successfully computed over India from the INSAT-3D Imager\nobservations.\nThis is a preliminary study carried out for computing the broadband land surface albedo from the\nINSAT-3D Imager sensor, however detailed study is underway to establish the proposed method\nwith more simulations involving additional land cover types. There is also a requirement to\nenhance the cloud removal technique, which will minimize the noise observed in the albedo\nretrieval. Moreover, issue related to the calibration of INSAT -3D Imager radiance has to be\nrectified for robust retrieval of the broadband albedo.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 41\nFigure 3. Broadband albedo derived from INSAT-3D Imager data from the proposed method.\n3.6. Summary and Future scope\nIn this document, we have presented the algorithm theoretical basis (Version 1.0) for the\nbroadband land surface albedo from INSAT-3D Imager dataset. The technique involves\ndevelopment of a direct-estimation of broadband land surface albedo from the observations of the\nINSAT-3D Imager sensor, which is available from the geostationary platform. Extensive\ntheoretical modelling study was carried out, where an atmospheric radiative transfer model was\nused to simulate the TOA signals in two broad bands of Imager sensor for diverse land atmospheric\nscenario. After the simulation exercise was over, a relationship between TOA reflectances and\nland-surface broadband albedos was developed from the simulation results, which provided a set\nof conversion coefficients. A separate set of narrow to broadband conversion coefficients for\neach of the major land covers was generated for INSAT-3D Imager data. Using the proposed\nmethod broadband land surface albedo maps were generated over India from the TOA\nobservations of INSAT-3D Imager sensor. Validation of the retrieved albedo will be carried\nout by comparing it with MODIS albedo products and in-situ albedo measurements. The\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 42\npreliminary study has provided encouraging results; however, a detailed analysis is underway\ninvolving more theoretical simulations and removing the errors due to erroneous cloud mask.\nMoreover, serious issues related to (1) the calibration of INSAT-3D Imager radiance and (2)\ncloud cover have to be resolved for robust retrieval of the broadband albedo on routine basis.\nReferences\nBrest C. and Goward S.

ET is a central process in the climate\nsystem and a nexus of water, energy & carbon cycle (Jung et.al. 2010). Land evapotranspiration\n(ET) is an essential component in global water, energy and carbon cycles, and provides a link\nbetween the atmosphere and the Earth‚Äôs surface (Betts et al., 1996; Jim√©nez et al., 2011; Tang et\nal., 2014; Zhang et al., 2012, 2015). It is also an important indicator of hydrologic and heat\nvariations under a changing climate and anthropogenic interference (Brutsaert and Parlange, 1998;\nOhmura and Wild, 2002; Wang and Dickinson, 2012). Accurate quantification of ET is thus critical\nfor understanding the hydro-climatologic processes and the interactions of the Earth system\n(Rodell and Famiglietti, 2002). However, the estimation of large-scale ET from ground-based\nmeasurements alone remains challenging due to the sparse network of point observations and the\nhigh spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability of ET (Xu and Singh, 2005; Xue et al., 2013).\nTo address this limitation, a number of global ET products have been derived in recent years,\nincluding remote sensing-based products (Su, 2002; Muet al., 2007, 2011; Zhang et al., 2009, 2010;\nMiralles et al., 2011b; Yang et al., 2013). There are many methods mentioned in the literature\nsuch as SEBAL (Bastiaanssen 2013), TSEB (Norman & Becker, 1995) and SEBS (Su, 2002). Most\nof the model uses the operationally available polar/ near-polar orbit satellite datasets such as\nMODIS, ASTER, LANDSAT have long been utilized for the estimation of ET from field to\nregional scale. However, the output records suffer from spatial and temporal gaps due to cloud\ncover and in-frequent image availability based on satellite overpass schedule. However,\ngeostationary satellites, have high temporal resolution continuously measuring several factors\nrelated to land surface and the atmosphere over large regional scales. Thus, they have high potential\nin calculating land surface and water cycle at hourly temporal resolution. This shows the vital role\nof geostationary satellite in modelling Evapotranspiration on spatial scale. Operational ET\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 46\nproducts are available over US and Europe using thermal remote sensing data from geostationary\nmeteorological satellite data such as GOES (Anderson et al, 2007) and MSG-SEVIRI (Hu et al,\n2015).\n4.2.1. Overview and background\nMost of the methods used for modelling evapotranspiration uses energy surface balance framework\nusing thermal infrared remote sensing. This describes the heat and water transfer from land surface\nto overlying atmosphere within surface layer of Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) :\nR - G = H + ŒªE (1)\nn\nWhere, R is the net surface radiation, G is the soil heat flux, H is the sensible heat flux and ŒªE is\nn\nthe latent heat flux. Remote sensing technique can provide spatial and temporal information of\nNormalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), surface albedo, surface\nemissivity, and radiometric surface temperature, most of which are indispensable to the models\nand methods that partition the available energy (Li et. al. 2009 , Mauser et.al. 1998). A large\nnumber of efforts have been made to incorporate remotely sensed surface temperature in\ncombination with other critical variables, e.g., NDVI and albedo into ET modeling during the\npast three decades (kala et.al. 2008). It was Penman (Penman 1948) who laid the foundation for\nrelating evapotranspiration to meteorological variables (Allen et.al. 1998). Model simulations or\nempirical equations requiring meteorological data are the traditional way of estimating\nevapotranspiration such as gradient method, Bowen ratio method, eddy covariance method,\nlysimeter method. Malamos et.al. (2015) used PM method to estimate ET on the field scale level\nwhile Uddin et.al. (2013) used the Bowen ratio method & EC method to estimate latent heat fluxes.\nHowever, because of some practical reasons like diversity in land covers or temporal changes in\nthe landscape, these methods may not represent the evapotranspiration at regional-scale effectively\n(Zhang et.al. 1995) The most frequently used method for estimating evapotranspiration at present\nis the Penman-Monteith equation. The energy balance concept and net radiation are used as the\nprincipal parameters in most of the remote sensing methods for estimating evapotranspiration (Li\net.al. 2002). Till date, several energy balance algorithms are available for calculating ET through\nremote sensing. such as SEBAL (Bastiaanssen et.al.1998) and SEBS (Su,2002). They are single\nsource model which consider soil and plant as single source. In addition to these, there are dual-\nsource or two-source (soil and vegetation canopy) models, e.g. TSEB (Norman & Becker 1995),\nSEBI (Menenti & Choudhury 1993) and ALEXI (Anderson, Norman, Diak, kustas & Mecikalski,\n1997). Therefore, considering the characteristics and significance of the various ET methods\ndeveloped over the past decades, precise estimation of ET over regional scale based on the remote\nsensing technology has become a critical question in ET related studies.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 47\n4.2.2. Objectives\nThe objectives of this document are:\n(i) To outline the algorithm for the estimation of day-time and daily Evapotranspiration\n(ET) over land in all-sky conditions\n(ii) To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain\nfor automation of ET product generation\n(iii) To describe validation strategy against available in-situ measurements and other\navailable satellite-based and reanalysis products.\n4.2.3. Instrument and characteristics of input products\n4.2.3.1. Indian geostationary satellite INSAT 3DR\nThe Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS),\nDepartment of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT-\n3DR carries a multi-spectral Imager (optical radiometer) capable of generating the images of the\nearth in six wavelength bands significant for meteorological observations, namely, visible (0.55-\n0.75 ¬µm), shortwave infrared (1.55-1.68 ¬µm), middle infrared (3.8-4.1 ¬µm), water vapor (6.5-7.1\n¬µm) and two bands in thermal infrared (10.3-11.3 ¬µm & 11.5-12.5 ¬µm) regions. It also has 19\nchannel sounder, which is the first such payload to be flown on an ISRO satellite mission. The\nspatial resolution is 1 km x 1 km for VIS/SWIR band and 4 km x 4 km for thermal IR and 8 km X\n8 km bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) (2014)\nprovides both ‚Äòfull-globe‚Äô and ‚Äòsector‚Äô data products in all the six bands of imager at half-an-hour\ninterval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum 48 acquisitions\non a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for servo, line loss,\nradiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3D/3DR data products scheduler.\nThis results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse Mercator\n(TM) projection. The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 1617 rows x 1615 columns\nfor Asia Mercator sector product.\n4.2.3.2. Required inputs\nOperational all-sky hourly Net radiation product, sliding monthly noon-time composite of land\nsurface albedo, instantaneous LST from INSAT 3DR\nThe proposed algorithm for ET will use the INSAT Net radiation hourly product in the MMDRPS\noperational chain. The net radiation will be computed from daily insolation product at 4 km from\nINSAT 3D/3DR, proposed operational albedo product from INSAT 3D/3DR, hourly forecast air\ntemperature and relative humidity from WRF model, land surface temperature (LST) from INSAT\n3D/3DR, using the surface emissivity obtained from 10 year historical MODIS database or real-\ntime composite NDVI at 1-4 km from other sources (https://www.eumetsat.int/website/home/\nSatellites/CurrentSatellites/Meteosat) for SEVIRI NDVI product for Indian ocean coverage,\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 48\nNational Data Centre, NRSC, Hyderabad for OCM-2 & AWiFS NDVI). The net radiation needs to\nbe made operationally available under clear and cloudy sky conditions to generate latent heat flux\nand Evapotranspiration (ET).\n4.2.3.3. Hourly short-range forecast from WRF\nWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is used for\nAll India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, primitive equation\nmodel with multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes. The WRF Model is\nintegrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45 km, 15 km and 5 km\nfor the All India, with grid points 260√ó235, 352√ó373 and 676√ó721 in x and y directions for the\ndomains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top of the model\natmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all available\nconventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model initial\nconditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at\nMOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database\nand assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS. The operational forecast is\navailable at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at hourly intervals up to 72 hours. Similarly, IMD is\nalso running a WRF model in a double domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 9 km\nand 3 km for the RSMC Domain and All India domain respectively. The model has 46 vertical\nlevels with the top of the model atmosphere located at 50 hPa. In this algorithm only temperature\nand relative humidity at 2-meter height from surface will be used for estimation of ET. For testing\nthe prototype algorithm, SAC WRF forecasts at 5km resolution will be used. However, for\noperational implementation in MMDRPS, IMD WRF forecasts will be used.\n4.3. Inputs\n4.3.1.

Algorithm functional specifications\n4.4.1.

This method can\nbe used by simultaneously solving four state equations as mentioned by (Mallick et.al. 2014) to\nestimate latent heat flux. The four internal state equations needs to be solved in iterative manner\nto compute LE are given below:\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n…Ö =\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 ∆≥(\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000) (3)\n\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\n(\n\u0000\u0000…Ö\n)\n‚àÜT = (4)\n∆≥ …Ö\ng =g\n\u0000\n\u0000\n‚àó\u0000 \u0000\u0000\ns B (5)\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\ng\nB =\n∆ç \u0000\u0000(‚àÜ\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n∆≥\n\u0000\u0000\n)\n(6)\nHere …Ö is the evaporative fraction, ‚àÜT is expressed as Ts-Ta where Ta (oC) is the air temperature\nand Ts is land surface temperature (oC).e is effective vapour pressure (hPa), e is atmospheric\n\u0000 \u0000\nvapour pressure (hPa) at Ta height of measurement and \u0000‚àóis saturationvapour pressure at Ts.

In the flow chart (Figure 1),\nT is the surface dew point temperature (0C), M is moisture availability at surface (0-1) T is dew\nSD D\npoint temperature (0C).\nThe input needed for computation of ŒªE mentioned in equation (2) are air temperature (T ), LST\na\n(T ), Relative humidity (RH), Net radiation (R ) and soil heat flux (G), For clear sky conditions,\ns n\nhourly Net radiation (R ) product will be used as input. Air temperature and relative humidity will\nn\nbe taken from WRF model at 2m height on hourly scale. LST obtained from INSAT 3DR will be\nused on-hourly scale as input to this model.\nIn order to solve net surface available energy, …∏ (=Rn ‚ÄìG) as mentioned in equation (2) and (6)\nwe need to obtain soil heat flux. The soil heat flux can be obtained by two approaches:\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 51\nFigure 1: Diagrammatic representation of the core equations used to recover the internal state\nvariables in STIC (Mallick et.al. 2014)\n4.4.2. Soil heat flux model\nStatitsical approach\nThe ratio of daytime soil heat flux and net radiation from AMS measurements over short vegetative\nsystems were found to produce logarithmic relation with INSAT 3A CCD NDVI at 1 km. This\nrelation was used to derive the soil heat flux (Bhattacharya et. al . 2014).\nFigure 2: Relationship of net radiation fraction of soil heat flux (G) with NDVI\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 52\nIt resulted into a significant correlation coefficient of 0.8. The spread is relatively more which\ncould be due to difference in situ measurement footprints of soil heat flux and net radiation, and\nINSAT 3A CCD. This function was used to estimate soil heat flux through inversion from regional\ndaytime net radiation and INSAT NDVI.\nThis relation G = -12.5 ln(NDVI)-1.317 will be used to compute the G/R ratio. Using all-sky net\nn\nradiation product from INSAT 3DR and sliding monthly NDVI composite from other sources,\ndaytime G and net available energy can be computed. Since nighttime soil heat flux is very\nnegligible, daytime G will be scaled to daily 24 hours average G to derive daily …∏.\nThermal inertia-based (TI) physical modelling approach\nThe physical model for the land surface soil heat flux estimate based on the harmonic\nanalysis of soil surface temperature (HM model) is described by Murray and Verhoef et.al. (2007)\nas follows:\nG = Œì *( ( 1 - \u0000 \u0000 )* (‚àë\u0000\u0000 ‚àö\u0000œé sin(nœét + …∏n + \u0000 ‚àí \u0000Œî\u0000 )) = Œì * J (7)\n\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 s\n\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\nwhere G (W m‚àí2) is the at-surface soil heat flux, Œì (J m‚àí2 K‚àí1 s‚àí0.5) is the soil thermal inertia, M is\nthe total number of harmonics used An is the amplitude of the n‚Äôth soil surface temperature (Ts)\nharmonic, œâ (rad s‚àí1) is the angular frequency, t is the time (s), œï (rad) is the phase shift of the\nn\nn‚Äôth soil surface temperature harmonic, and Js is the summation of harmonic terms of soil surface\ntemperature.\nThe parameter soil thermal inertia, Œì, is a key variable for estimating G0 using Eq. (10).\nMurray and Verhoef adopted the concept of normalized thermal conductivity (O. Johansen 1977)\nand developed a physical method to calculate Œì as\nœÑ = exp [œí (1- Sœí-Œ¥)] (œÑ - œÑ ) + œÑ (8)\nr * 0 0\nwhere Œì and Œì0 are the thermal inertia for saturated and air-dry soil (J m‚àí2 K‚àí1 s‚àí0.5) respectively.\nAlso œÑ = -1062.4 ”® + 1010.8 & œÑ = 788.2 (”® -1.29).

With the two boundary\nvalues (i.e., Œît =1.5 h for fc=1 and Œît=0h for fc=0), a linear approach is proposed here to describe\ntime offset Œît as function of vegetation fraction (f ). NDVI data from OCM, MSG-SEVRI or\nc\nMODIS will be used to compute fc\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 53\nŒît= 1.5 ¬∑ fc (10)\nOnce the soil heat flux is obtained then …∏ is solved if all clear-sky instances prevail throughout\nthe day.\n7.4.3 Cloudy sky Latent heat flux (ŒªE cld)\nThe latent heat flux under cloudy sky conditions can be estimated using equation (2). Under cloudy\nsky conditions LST is not available, so the challenge is to retrieve LST under cloudy-sky condtions\nthrough inverse modelling.\n4.5. LST retrieval under cloudy-sky\nFrom the proposed net radiation product, the all-sky net radiation data are pre-requisite for LST\nrecovery under cloudy-sky conditions. The net surface longwave radiation will be obtained as a\ndifference from net surface radiation and net surface shortwave radiation under cloudy sky\nconditions. Net surface shortwave radiation will be obtained from instantaneous surface insolation\nproduct and noon-time sliding monthly albedo composite. The incoming longwave radiation will\nbe deducted using WRF forecast data to retain outgoing longwave radiation (Rlocld). By inverting\nthe equation of stefan-boltzmann law we can recover LST.\nLST = (R /(∆ê œÉ))1/4 (11)\ncloud locld s\nHere under cloudy sky conditions the 30-day composite value of surface emissivity for cloudy\npixel from from historical MODIS data or sliding monthly NDVI composite will be used.\nIf the LST is recovered then by using equation 2, we can obtain latent heat flux under cloudy\nconditions. (LE )\ncld\nIn this case also, like clear sky conditions for solving …∏ (Rn ‚ÄìG) as mentioned in equation (2) &\n(6) we need to obtain soil heat flux. If LST is recovered under cloudy sky conditions the soil heat\nflux can be obtained by using TI- based model as discussed above. Here, in case of cloudy\nconditions for vegetation fraction (fc) we will use sliding monthly NDVI composite value cloudy\npixel from external sources.

Sensitivity analysis of STIC model simulated latent heat flux on LST\nand Albedo\nThe accuracy of STIC model heavily depends on the quality of land surface temperature data due\nto its role in retrieving T and M. One-dimensional sensitivity analysis was carried out to quantify\nSD\nthe impacts of uncertainty in T and albedo on ŒªE. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by\nS\nincreasing and decreasing LST systematically from its original value while keeping the other\nvariables and parameters constant. This procedure was selected because the fluxes and other\nintermediate outputs of STIC model reflect an integrated effect of change in LST. Firstly, surface\nfluxes (ŒªE) were computed using the original LST data obtained from EC tower observations. Then\nLST was increased and decreased at constant interval and a new set of fluxes were computed. It\nwas found that ŒªE was sensitive to the LST uncertainties with a magnitude of error ranging 2-12\n% for LST error in the range of 0.5 - 3K.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 57\nTable 4 : Sensitivity analysis of ŒªE on LST\nStations Geographic Deviation (%) in ŒªE from reference\nlocations\n(LST (LST (LST (LST (LST (LST\n¬±0.5K) ¬±1K) ¬±1.5K) ¬±2K) ¬±2.5K) ¬±3K)\n+\u0000 % +\u0000 % +\u0000 % +\u0000 % +\u0000 % +\u0000 %\nNawagam-Gujarat, semi 22.800N,\narid cropland\n72.570E 1.1 2.7 5.7 6.4 8.9 10.2\nJaisalmer-Rajasthan, arid 26.990N,\ngrassland\n71.340E 0.9 1.7 3.6 5.8 7.4 9.6\nSamastipur-Bihar, Sub- 26.000N,\nhumid cropland\n85.670E 1.6 2.1 4.2 7.2 9.1 11.6\nTable 5.

Introduction\nMonitoring of the earth‚Äôs radiation budget is essential for improving our understanding of the\nearth‚Äôs climate and is changes since the radiative energy exchanges at the top of the atmosphere\n(TOA) and at the earth‚Äôs surface regulate the redistribution of energy and determine the energy\nbalance of the earth-atmosphere system. Rather than examining radiation budget as a whole, it is\nvery important to quantify its components, namely incoming and outgoing shortwave and\nlongwave radiation, within the atmosphere, and at the surface. Radiation budget and its different\ncomponents also listed in essential climatic variables of the emerging Global Framework for\nClimate Services (BojinSki et al., 2014). Net surface radiation (R ) is a key parameter for energy\nn\nand mass exchange between land and atmosphere and also play a vital role in many biological\nprocesses (Anderson et al. 2007). Radiative energy is the driving force for land surface\nmeteorological and micrometeorological processes, such as sensible and latent heat\n(evapotranspiration) transfer. The surface radiation balance is one of the major factors that\ndetermine the surface temperature of the vegetation canopy and the underlying soil substrate. Thus,\naccurate estimates of R are essential for understanding the land surface energy distribution, the\nn\nformation and transformation of air masses, snow melting calculations (Male and Granger, 1981),\nmodeling crop transpiration and evapotranspiration, and addressing water resource management\n(Bisht and Bras, 2011). R (coupled with other energy balance component such as ground heat\nn\nflux) serves as a key driving force for the evapotranspiration (ET). Estimation of R is necessary\nn\nbecause it is a key input for land surface process and hydrological models, and are also used\nroutinely to calculate evapotranspiration (Monteith, 1965; Kustas & Norman,1997), which is a\ncritical component of agricultural, hydrological, and ecological research. Over the years, various\nET and land surface models have been developed that use remote sensing and ancillary surface\nand ground-based observations (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998). All ET models require estimates of R\nn\nat spatial scale. Mallick et al (2009) and Westerhoff (2015) were observed sensitivity of R from\nn\n10 to 40% for ET over different agro-ecosystems.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 64\n5.2.1. Overview and background\nR is the difference between the incoming and outgoing shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes\nn\nat the surface. Mathematically described as:\nR ÔÄΩR ÔÄ´R (a)\nn ns nl\nR ÔÄΩR ÔÄ≠R ÔÄΩ(1ÔÄ≠ÔÅ°)R\nns si so si (b)\nR ÔÄΩR ÔÄ´R (c)\nnl li lo\nwhere R is the incoming shortwave radiation (Wm‚àí2), R is the reflected outgoing shortwave\nsi so\nradiation (Wm‚àí2), which is calculated by R = Œ± √ó R , Œ± is the shortwave broadband albedo\nso si\n(dimensionless), thus R is the net shortwave radiation, R is the incoming longwave radiation\nns li\n(Wm‚àí2), R is the outgoing longwave radiation (Wm‚àí2), and R is the net longwave radiation\nlo nl\n(Wm‚àí2). R is normally positive during the daytime because net shortwave radiation dominates,\nn\nbut negative during the nighttime because net longwave radiation dominates (Allen et al., 1998).\nIf all four components of Eq. (a) are known, the calculation of R is straightforward. Indeed, many\nn\nradiation measurement towers measure these four components of radiation, thereby allowing us to\ndetermine R a given instance and location. Various satellite observations have been used to\nn\ngenerate radiation products at regional and global scales (Liang et al., 2010, 2013b; Zhang et al.,\n2014). MeteoSat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG\nSEVIRI) Satellite observations from the visible to near-infrared spectrum have been used for\nestimating incident solar radiation and surface albedo, and thermal-infrared data for estimating\nlongwave radiation. To map the R , it is necessary to combine remote sensing observations with\nn\nsurface and atmospheric data, where the spatial variability is mainly modeled by means of albedo,\nemissivity, and land surface temperature maps obtained from satellite data. There are roughly two\ntypes of algorithms for estimating R (Liang et al., 2010), one calculates radiative quantities from\nn\nthe derived satellite products of all relevant atmospheric and surface variables (e.g., cloud,\natmospheric temperature, LST, air and surface emissivity), and another estimates radiation directly\nfrom satellite observed radiance using a regression equation established from extensive radiative\ntransfer simulations or using ground measurements.\n5.2.2. Objectives\nThe objectives of this document are:\n(iv) To outline the algorithm for the estimation of hourly (R ) and daily net surface radiation\nn\n(R ) over land in clear and cloudy sky\nndly\n(v) To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain\nfor automation of R andR product generation\nn ndly\n(vi) To describe validation strategy against available in-situ measurements amd other\nconcurrent satellite products.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 65\n5.2.3. Instrument and characteristics of input products\n5.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite INSAT 3DR\nThe Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS),\nDepartment of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT-\n3DR carries a multi-spectral Imager (optical radiometer) capable of generating the images of the\nearth in six wavelength bands significant for meteorological observations, namely, visible (0.55-\n0.75 ¬µm), shortwave infrared (1.55-1.68 ¬µm), middle infrared (3.8-4.1 ¬µm), water vapor (6.5-7.1\n¬µm) and two bands in thermal infrared (10.3-11.3 ¬µm & 11.5-12.5 ¬µm) regions. It also has 19\nchannel sounder, which is the first such payload to be flown on an ISRO satellite mission. The\nspatial resolution of VIS band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km for WV and thermal IR bands. The\nintroduction of INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) provides (Bhattacharya\net al. 2013) both ‚Äòfull-globe‚Äô and ‚Äòsector‚Äô data products in all the six bands of imager at half-an-\nhour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum 48\nacquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for servo,\nline loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3DR data products\nscheduler. This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse\nMercator (TM) projection. The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 1617 rows x 1615\ncolumns for Asia Mercator sector product.\n5.2.3.2 Operational surface insolation product\nA spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to determine\nintegrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-hourly observations\nfrom an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3DR will be used to provide minimum ground\nbrightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30 days, cloud top albedo, brightness\ntemperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to these models in addition to global eight-day\naerosol optical depth at 550 nm and columnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme will be implemented\nto obtain daily insolation (in MJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout\nthe day for all-sky conditions (clear + cloudy). The whole algorithm has been operationalized\n(Bhattacharya et al, 2010 & 2012b) and daily insolation product is available at 4 km from INSAT\n3D and at 8 km from Kalpana-1 spatial resolution respectively with Transverse Mercator projection\nroutinely from MOSDAC site (http://www.mosdac.gov.in).\n5.2.3.3 Operational proposed land surface albedo product\nThe proposed algorithm for R will use the other proposed INSAT land surface albedo three hourly\nn\nor daily composite product in the IMDPS operational chain.\n5.3.

Operational product of WRF short-range forecast\nWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is used for\nAll India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, primitive equation\nmodel with multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes.\nThe WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45\nkm, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260√ó235, 352√ó373 and 676√ó721 in x and\ny directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top\nof the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all\navailable conventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 67\ninitial conditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at\nMOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database\nand assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS and satellite observations (Kumar\net al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011) from India such as Oceansat-2 scatterometer wind data and other\nInternational agencies (e.g. EUMETCast).

Introduction\nThe shortwave radiative flux absorbed by the ocean surface plays an important role in the\natmospheric and oceanic circulation through air-sea interaction particularly over the warm pool\nregion of the Indian Ocean [Lukas, 1989]. The accurate information of surface Short Wave\nRadiation (SWR) would also result in significantly improved representation of the intra-annual\noceanic surface processes and long term surface variability. The diurnal variations in the Sea\nSurface Temperature (SST) are driven by the surface solar radiation that is modulated primarily by\nthe presence of cloudiness. The SWR data available through buoys have sparse coverage due to the\nlarge cost and maintenance involved. In the recent years there have been efforts to establish an\naccurate estimate of the surface shortwave radiation budget (SRB) over Tropical Ocean and to\nassess its impact on the climate change.\nThe tropical oceans with SST usually greater than 28 ¬∞C, forms a major part of the largest warm\npool on the earth. The variations of surface insolation over these warm pool regions are primarily\ndue to the variations in cloudiness which are manifestation of deep convection [Shinoda et al.,\n1998; Sengupta et al., 2001]. The long-term surface measurements of radiative fluxes are limited\nprimarily to the continental regions [Ohmura and Gilgen, 1991]. The satellite estimates of\ncloudiness and top of the atmosphere fluxes have been used in conjunction with radiative transfer\nmodels to produce global estimates of SRB over land and ocean [Li, 1995; Rossow and Zhang,\n1995; Whitlock et al., 1995; Gupta et al., 1997]. The most popular algorithms used in computing\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 77\nSRB estimates from satellite data are described by Pinker and Laszlo [1992] and Darnell et al.\n[1992].\nThe global Analysis, such as the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) [Kalnay et\nal., 1996], National Aeronautics and Space Administration/Data Assimilation Office (NASA/DAO)\n[Schubert et al., 1993], and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis\n[ERA, 1999] projects have provided climate researchers with alternative estimates of the earth‚Äôs\nSRB. Bony et al. [1997] used data from the NASA/DAO and NCEP reanalysis for the period 1987‚Äì\n88 to compare SWR at the surface to satellite estimates in the Tropics (30¬∞S‚Äì30¬∞N). They found\nthe annual mean bias in NCEP SWR over the tropical ocean ranging from -10 to -30 W m-2, while\nNASA/DAO SWR biases ranged from -50 W m-2 in subsidence regions of the subtropics to -25 W\nm-2 in convective regions near the equator.\nTable-1 provides a summary of presently available SWR products from different source alongwith\ntheir merits and demerits.\nTable-1 SOURCES OF SWR\nSSppaattiiaall//\nSSoouurrccee TTeemmppoorraall AAddvvaannttaaggee DDiissaaddvvaannttaaggee\nRReess..\nBBuuooyy OObbsseerrvvaattiioonnss hhoouurrllyy AAccccuurraattee SSppaarrssee oobbsseerrvvaattiioonnss\nAAttmmoosspphheerriicc mmooddeellss 11--22¬∞¬∞//\nGGlloobbaall PPrroodduuccttss IInnaaccccuurraattee\n((RReeaannaallyyssiiss pprroodduuccttss)) 66--hhoouurrllyy\nIISSCCCCPP 228800 kkmm// CCoommppuuttaattiioonnaallllyy eexxppeennssiivvee\nGGlloobbaall PPrroodduucctt\n((SSaatteelllliittee ddaattaa ++ RRTT mmooddeellss)) 33--hhoouurrllyy ((NNoonn--aavvaaiillaabbiilliittyy iinn rreeaall ttiimmee))\nGGEEWWEEXX 11¬∞¬∞// CCoommppuuttaattiioonnaallllyy eexxppeennssiivvee\nGGlloobbaall PPrroodduucctt\n((SSaatteelllliittee ddaattaa ++ RRTT mmooddeellss)) 33--hhoouurrllyy ((NNoonn--aavvaaiillaabbiilliittyy iinn rreeaall ttiimmee))\nLLYY pprroodduuccttss ((LLaarrggee aanndd\n11¬∞¬∞// CCoommppuuttaattiioonnaallllyy eexxppeennssiivvee\nYYeeaaggrree,, 22000011)) GGlloobbaall PPrroodduuccttss\nDDaaiillyy ((NNoonn--aavvaaiillaabbiilliittyy iinn rreeaall ttiimmee))\nSSaatteelllliittee ‚Äì‚ÄìMMooddeell mmeerrggeedd\nEEmmppiirriiccaall rreellaattiioonnss ~~1100 kkmm//\nFFaasstt aanndd SSiimmppllee RReeggiioonnaall pprroodduuccttss\n((SShhiinnooddaaeett aall,, 11999988)) DDaaiillyy\nNote: LY products largely known as Large and Yeager product follows the earlier approach of Large and Nurser [2001],\nin which the NCEP surface radiation and precipitation are replaced by satellite-based estimates.\nThe present Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document describes a methodology to estimate SWR\nfrom half-hourly estimates of Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR) obtained from Kalpana\nobservations. Although we have shown the results with Kalpana derived OLR, but the same\nalgorithm has been tested with the data from other Indian GEO satellites.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 78\n6.3. Physical basis of the SWR Algorithm\nThe OLR-based SWR estimates have better accuracy for convective regions because the variations\nof surface insolation over the warm pool ocean region are primarily due to the variations in\ncloudiness. Variations in cloudiness are manifestation of deep convection; therefore, OLR is a good\nproxy for convection. Shinoda et al [1998] showed in their study that the coefficient of correlations\nbetween SWR and OLR were maximum (~0.8) at the equator that decreases as one goes away from\nthe equator and reduces to less than 0.5 beyond 10ÀöN/S latitudes.\nShinoda et al. [1998] proposed a simple empirical relationship (referred hereafter as SH98), valid\nover warm pool oceanic regions, to estimate the daily averaged SWR from the daily averaged OLR\nproducts obtained from the NOAA polar orbiting satellite. Shahi et al. [2010], proposed the use of\na high temporal resolution data of OLR to improve the diurnal sampling in order to match that of\nthe buoy SWR in computing daily averaged estimates. They demonstrated a significant\nimprovement in the SH98 by using daytime average of OLR obtained from half-hourly\ngeostationary satellite observations. The rationale behind using the daytime OLR as against daily\n(24-hr average OLR) is that the daily averaged SWR is affected solely by the presence of day-time\nclouds, and therefore the algorithm performs better than that used in SH98. The empirical\nrelationship developed by Shahi et al [2010], however, was developed for a single buoy location,\nand is not valid over other locations, particularly over different latitude regions. Shahi et al. [2011]\nfurther improved the algorithm to make it valid over a wide Indian Ocean region by including the\nsolar zenith angle in the empirical formulations. The detailed formulation is given in the following\nsection.\n6.4. Formulation of the SWR Algorithm\nThe improved algorithm developed at Space Applications Centre (SAC) to compute the SWR from\nOLR observations from geostationary satellites is described in detail by Shahi et al. [2011]. The\nmethodology was developed using a large collocated dataset of the spatially well distributed (in\nlatitude) buoy measured SWR and the half-hourly estimates of OLR from geostationary satellite\nobservations over Indian Ocean region. The generalization of the empirical relationship has been\nachieved by normalizing the SWR values to nadir locations by making use of the solar zenith angle\ninformation.\nThe in-situ SWR is the down-welling shortwave radiation measured by the Research Moored Array\nfor African-Asian-Australian Monsoon Analysis and Prediction (RAMA) buoy. Daily average\nshortwave radiation is computed as a 24 hour average. Fig.1 shows the locations of the 13 RAMA\nbuoys in the warm pool region of Indian Ocean used for the algorithm development for the period\nof 2002-2009. The OLR products have been obtained from EUMETSAT for the Indian Ocean\ncoverage of the Meteosat-5 (sub-satellite point at 57¬∞E) upto December 2006 and Meteosat-7 (sub-\nsatellite point at 63¬∞E) beyond January 2007. Meteosat derived OLR was estimated from the half-\nhourly observations in the thermal infrared (TIR, 10.5-12.5¬µm) and water vapor absorption (WV,\n5.7-7.1¬µm) channels at spatial resolution of 5 km, using the algorithm developed by Schmetz and\nLiu [1988]. The accuracy of geostationary satellite derived OLR is shown to be ~3 W m-2 [Schmetz\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 79\nand Liu, 1988; Singh et al., 2007] using radiative transfer model based simulation studies. The\nvalidation of geostationary satellite derived OLR with the broadband OLR observations from the\nClouds and Earth‚Äôs Radiant Energy System (CERES) onboard polar orbiting satellites TRMM and\nEOS-Terra reveal the accuracy to be ~7 W m-2 at a daily time-scale [Ba et al., 2003].\nA collocated dataset of daily averaged SWR (24-hr average) using buoy data and daytime averaged\nOLR (duration of sunshine) was generated for each of the buoy locations. The daytime averaged\nOLR is obtained using average of the half-hourly observations between sunrise to sunset (computed\nFigure 1: Locations of RAMA buoys in Indian Ocean overlaid on a sample Meteosat\nOLR coverage\nusing solar zenith angle less than 80o). A training dataset, using collocated observations from each\nof the buoys that represent complete annual cycle, was created for the algorithm development and\nthe remaining data treated as the independent testing dataset.\nSAC-Algorithm [Shahi et al., 2011] o used the normalized SWR w.r.t. the nadir viewing angle, i.e.\nSWR sec2(ÔÅ¢), in the empirical formulation, where ÔÅ¢ is solar zenith angle at local noon. The\npolynomial least square equation between normalized SWR and OLR was found to be:\n(SWR) sec2(ÔÅ¢) = -0.002434 (OLR)2 + 2.5401 (OLR) ‚Äì 220.75\nwhich provides the final expression for computing the SWR as:\nSWR = cos2(ÔÅ¢) [-0.002434 (OLR)2 + 2.5401 (OLR) ‚Äì 220.75]\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 80\nThe improved algorithm is referred as SAC-SWR Algorithm. The root-mean-squared-error\n(RMSE) computed for SAC-SWR estimates from the buoy observations was found to be ~28 W\nm-2 in the testing dataset in contrast to the ~39 W m-2 obtained using SH98.\nThe SAC-SWR algorithm was also compared with other datasets for the year 2007 available from:\n(i) Global Energy and Water-Cycle Experiment Surface Radiation Budget (GEWEX-SRB) project\nof NASA World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), (ii) International Satellite Cloud\nClimatology Project Surface Radiative Flux Dataset (ISCCP-FD), and (iii) National Center for\nEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) analysis. The Spatial resolution of GEWEX-SRB, ISCCP-FD\nand NCEP SWR products are 1¬∞, 2.8¬∞ and 1.875¬∞, respectively. The RMSE computed for different\nSWR products from buoy SWR shows that RMSE for SAC-SWR is lowest for the entire range of\nSWR values, indicating that the accuracy of the SAC-SWR is best under all sky conditions\nfollowed closely by GEWEX-SWR.\nFor combined dataset RMSE for SAC-SWR is 27.3 W m-2, which is the smallest, followed by\n32.7, 37.5 and 59.6 W m-2, respectively, for GEWEX, ISCCP and NCEP SWR products. The\nestimate of the standard error on weekly time scales is much smaller than that on daily time\nscales, with values of 11.8, 13.4, 15.3, and 32.8 Wm‚àí2 for SAC, GEWEX, ISCCP, and NCEP\nproducts, respectively.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 81\n6.5.

Background\nNumerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models has become an indispensable tool for providing\nweather forecast. These models are immensely benefited from various in-situ and satellite\nobservations. These observations are used for correcting model forecast trajectories, model output\nvalidation and model parameter tuning. Ingestion of various observations has now become a state-\nof-art and also rapidly growing to meet the challenges posed by huge amount of available\nobservations. With the advancement and maturing of data assimilation (DA) techniques direct\nsatellite observed radiance (or brightness temperatures) are operationally assimilated by various\noperational agencies. Assimilation of satellite observed radiances can be primarily subdivided into\ntwo classes: assimilation of clear sky brightness temperature and assimilation of all sky (clear and\ncloudy both) observation. Though, cloudy regions probably have a large impact on the accuracy\nof the NWP model predictions (McNally 2002; Kumar et al. 2014), but the direct assimilation of\ncloudy radiances is still beyond the scope of existing global NWP systems (Pavelin et al. 2008). This\nis due to the fact, that assimilation of cloudy radiances requires an observation operator having\nrealistic representation of cloud effects, and a NWP model capable of accurately representing\ncloud at same scales (Chevallier et al. 2004). Such kind of capabilities of existing NWP model is in\ndevelopment phase and fast radiative transfer (RT) model have large uncertainties over cloudy\nregions, and have complex nonlinearity in assimilation when clouds exist (Bauer et al. 2011).\nTherefore, cloudy infrared (IR) radiance is still part of ongoing research and development activities\nand is not the part of operational assimilation system. Nevertheless, the method of assimilation of\nclear sky brightness temperature (satellite observation which are not affected by the presence of\nclouds) has already reached to matured stage, therefore, used operationally in providing weather\nforecast. Thus clear sky brightness temperature (CSBT) is a very important parameter from the\nNWP data assimilation applications. clear sky radiance assimilation has become the indispensable\npart of assimilation system. For clear sky radiance assimilation, it is essential to eliminate the\ncloudy pixels in order to retain only clear-sky radiances only. Usually a binary mask (clear/cloudy)\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 86\nis prepared from satellite data (Zupanski et al. 2007; Razagui et al. 2011). Pangaud et al. (2009)\nand Eresmaa (2014) found that if cloudy radiances are assimilated as clear radiances, the quality\nof the NWP analysis/prediction impacted negatively.\n7.3. Objective\nThe main objective of this document is to provide the theoretical basis for calculating clear sky\nbrightness temperature (CSBT) for INSAT-3D/3DR TIR-1 and water vapor channels. The proposed\nalgorithm will be applied to estimate CSBT over 0.50x0.50 field of regard (FOR) along with\nstatistical parameters and a confidence flag that will help in using CSBT value in DA process.\nCSBT product is calculated for only clear pixels identified by INSAT-3D/3DR imager cloud mask\n(CMK) product. The algorithm has no limitation based on geographical location, therefore, can be\napplied to generate products over full disk or sector products. Nevertheless, the CSBT product is\ngenerated from only full disk product.\n7.4. Inputs\n7.4.1.

Algorithm Functional Specifications\n7.5.1. Overview\nThe clear sky brightness temperature (CSBT) from INSAT-3D/3DR imager is intended to be\ngenerated at 0.50x0.50 field of regard (FOR). CSBT product is generated at much coarser resolution\nthan the actual resolution of INSAT-3D/3DR imager observations which are available at nominal\nresolution of ~4 km at nadir for TIR-1, TIR-2, MIR and ~8 km for water vapor. The gridding\n(averaging) over all pixels within 0.50x0.50 FOR. This averaging is done to enhance the signal to\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 87\nnoise ratio and to make observation less correlated. Data assimilation warrants very accurate, and\nuncorrelated observations. CSBT product is aimed towards providing observations.\n7.5.2. Generation of CSBT\nAs it is evident from the name of parameter, CSBT is generated for clear sky pixels. Since this\nproduct is mainly used in NWP data assimilation, it is re-gridded at coarser resolution of 0.50x0.50\ngrid. This helps in reducing noise in value in BT as well as creating uncorrelated observations.\nGeneration of CSBT involves following steps:\n7.5.3. Preparation of latitude-longitude grid\nINSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR are orbiting in geostationary orbit and are located at 83.0 0E and 74\n0E, respectively. Therefore, the geographical extent of observed area by both the satellites is\ndifferent particularly in east-west direction. As both the satellites are in geostationary orbit, thus in\nprinciple, the viewing location of each pixel does not vary for different acquisitions. Based on the\nfixed grid of INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR, a latitude-longitude equal grid is selected and all further\nprocessing in done the same grid.\nFor INSAT-3D grid information is as follows:\nMin Latitude = -81.0; grid size=0.5 ; grid points in north-south direction=325\nMin Longitude = 1.0; grid size=0.50 ; grid points in east-west direction=325\nFor INSAT-3D grid information is as follows:\nMin Latitude = -81.0; grid size=0.5 ; grid points in north-south direction=325\nMin Longitude = -3.0; grid size=0.50 ; grid points in east-west direction=325\n7.5.4. Averaging of parameters\nA simple box average method is adopted to generate parameters. CSBT, satellite zenith angle and\nsolar zenith angle and land fraction (for a given grid) are generated. In data assimilation, satellite\nand solar zenith angles and land fraction are required along with CSBT. As already stated that\nCSBT is calculated for clear pixels only, therefore, for averaging operational cloud mask product\nis also used. INSAT-3D/3DR operational cloud mask product provides a flag which has one of the\nfour values 0,1,2 and 3. 0 indicates clear pixel, 1 indicates cloudy pixel, 3 is representative of\nprobably clear pixel and 3 indicates probably cloudy pixel. While calculating average of\naforementioned parameters, the total of pixels (N), clear pixels (N1) and probably clear pixels (N2)\nwithin a given grid are also counted. These counts (N, N1 and N2) determine whether CSBT\nproduct will be computed for a given grid or not. A dynamic threshold which is 10% of total count\nvalue N is taken. If total number of clear and probable clear pixels (N1+N2) is less than the\nthreshold value and CSBT and other products are not generated, but if this is greater than the\nthreshold value then it is checked if N1 is also greater then threshold or not. However, in both the\ncases CSBT and other parameters are computed but if N1 is less than the threshold then quality\nflag of CSBT is termed as not very good quality.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 88\nIn addition to the average of parameters, standard deviation of BT for a given box is also computed.\nThis standard deviation is also provided along with CSBT values to help in deciding the spread of\nBT value for a given box. More standard deviation may help in flagging out some of the CSBT\nvalue as it may have some contamination of cloud (or cloud edges)\n7.5.5. Quality indicators\nAs it is already discussed in previous section that a flag and standard deviation values are generated\nalong with CSBT product to provide user an indication of quality of CSBT value. The major\nconfidence in quality is determined by the number of clear pixels with a grid box, if more than 50%\nof grid is covered by clear pixels then that box is given the highest confidence flag 0, but if this\nnumber is between 25 to 50% the flag=1 and if it between 10 to 25% then flag=2.\nThese various flags are given to user to give them a flexibility in optimizing the number of data\npoints in assimilation and the quality of data set.\n7.6 Outputs\n7.6.1 Format of the output and the domain\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution Format\nClear Sky K 180.0 340.0 1-2K 0.5ÔÇ∞ x 0.5ÔÇ∞ HDF5\nbrightness\ntemperature\n7.7.

Data required\nClear-sky brightness temperature (CSBT) from INSAT-3D/3DR imager will be carried out by using\nvarious analysis such as NCMRWF analysis, GFS analysis and various reanalysis such as ERA\ninterim reanalysis.

Introduction\nThe aim of Clear-sky brightness temperature (CSBT) product is provide area average brightness\ntemperatures (Tb) for representing cloud free pixels. These products have been recently developed\nby Space Applications Centre under INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS)\nproject to be used in radiance assimilation in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The\nhigh-temporal resolution data of INSAT-3D Sounder (hourly observations) would be extremely\nuseful for monitoring and predicting of the fast developing weather systems through 4D-VAR\nradiance assimilation in NP models.\n8.3. Algorithm Description\nThe following sections provide details of the procedure for generating CSBT products:\n8.3.1. Cloud detection\nThe first step in CSBT product generation is to filter out cloud contaminated pixels from the\nSounder observations and generate a cloud-flag for each of the pixels. This section provides the\nphysical basis for detection of the cloudy pixels from INSAT-3D Sounder observations. The output\nof cloud mask algorithm gives the degree of presence of a cloud in it. This information enables the\nsubsequent steps to use this information for further processing.\nThe cloud detection algorithm is carried out in three steps. The flow chart is shown in fig.1.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 92\nFig.1: Flow chart of the Sounder cloud detection algorithm\nThe cloud detection methodology for INSAT-3D sounder follows operational GOES sounder cloud\ndetection procedure developed by Schreiner et al. (2001). This cloud detection algorithm uses 4\ninfrared channels and a visible channel during daytime for cloud detection and 5 infrared channels\nfor the detection of nighttime clouds. One additional infrared channel is used to detect clouds\nappearing at dawn time. The various channels used in cloud detection are summarized below:\nCh#3 - 13.3 ¬µm (‚ÄúCO2 absorption‚Äù, used for detection of thin cirrus)\nCh#6 - 12.6 ¬µm (‚ÄúModerate WV-absorption‚Äù, used in detecting some low level inversions)\nCh#7 - 12.0 ¬µm (‚ÄúWeak WV-absorption‚Äù, used in detecting low clouds and fog)\nCh#8 - 11.0 ¬µm (‚ÄúLongwave Window‚Äù, used in detecting various level of clouds)\nCh#17 - 4.0 ¬µm (‚ÄúShortwave Window‚Äù, used to detect low clouds and fog at night)\nCh#18 - 3.8 ¬µm (‚ÄúShortwave Window‚Äù, used to detect low clouds after sunrise)\nCh#19 - 0.6 ¬µm (‚ÄúVisible‚Äù band used in detecting various level of clouds during daylight)\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 93\nA series of tests are applied using these channels to detect stratus, cirrus (thin and opaque), fog,\nsnow and inversion. Here for cloud detection algorithm a 3x3 pixel field-of-regard (FOR) is used.\nThe FOR is moved by 1 pixel sequentially in E-W and N-S (along and across the scan-line) to\nmaximize the clear FOR detection. Two types of cloud flags are generated one each for the FOV\n(single pixel) and FOR (3 x 3 pixel box). In present algorithm the output contains three types of\ncloud-flags that are given by:\n0: Clear\n1: Cloudy\n2: Partially cloudy\nThe cloud detection procedure is carried out in three steps to filters out cloudy pixels very\naccurately and efficiently:\n(a). The first step is a very gross check and is applied on a FOR of 3x3 pixel box. If it fails in the\nfirst check then the whole FOR is declared as cloudy and it moves to the next FOR. In case of\npassing the first step a series of tests are applied on the FOR in second step. In third and final step,\na series of tests are applied on each FOV and the results of these tests decide the final outcome.\n(b). Primary Array Flag (PAF): This is first step of cloud detection to generate the primary array\nflag. Four tests are applied on a FOR to generate PAF. Generation of PAF requires computation of\ntwo thresholds T and T from ancillary information. T and T are computed using surface\nmax min max min\nskin temperature information which is available either through AWS or from model forecast. Here\nmodel forecast is used for surface skin temperature.\nT = T + 20, and T = T - 20\nmax S min S\nWhere, T is the surface skin temperature. After this calculation the following checks are applied:\nS\n1) Visible reflectance of the warmest pixel in FOR computed from Ch#8 (11¬µm) must be less than\na certain threshold value. The value of threshold for visible channel over land is 25% and over\nwater is 7%. The value of threshold may vary for low surface temperature and low sun angles. If\nthe surface skin temperature is less than 273K the threshold value over land is increased by a factor\nof 1.5. Similarly, to take care of low sun angles the land limit is multiplied by solar zenith angle.\nThis test is possible only for day time.\n2) The Ch#8 T (11¬µm) of warmest pixel must be less than T and must be greater than T .\nb max min\n3) Inversion test is applied on the difference of maximum Ch#8 T (11¬µm) and maximum Ch#18\nb\nT (3.8 ¬µm) within FOR. This test is applicable only during night time. For this test a threshold\nb\n(Th ) is calculated using an empirical relation using the NEÔÅÑT value of Ch#8 and Ch#18.\n1\nDifference between the warmest pixel of Ch#18 and the warmest pixel of Ch#8 must be greater\nthan the Th for a pixel to be clear.\n1\nIf any of these tests fail, then the whole box is assumed to be cloudy and not processed further,\notherwise it will proceed for secondary array flag (SAF) procedure.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 94\n(c). Secondary Array Flag (SAF): The first step of SAF is to compute skin temperature\nempirically using three channels, Ch#8 (T ), Ch#7 (T ) and Ch#18 (T ) and two channels Ch#8\nb8 b7 b18\n(11¬µm) and Ch#7 (12¬µm). These empirical relations for skin temperature are as follows:\nT = a0 + a1*T + a2* T + a3* T (using 3 channels)\nS3 b8 b7 b18\nT = b0 + b1* T + a2* T (using 2 channels)\nS2 b8 b7\nThese coefficients are pre-determined from a large simulated matchup dataset. The standard tests\nfor SAF are following:\nÔÇ∑ The difference between T and T must not be greater than 2K.\nS3 S2\nÔÇ∑ The ‚Äúcold sea test‚Äù only over ocean and this test fail if the highest T in FOR FOV is less\nb8\nthan 270K.\nÔÇ∑ The ‚Äúreflected sunglint test‚Äù checks the difference between brightness temperatures for the\nhighest T and T . The difference must be less than 10K.\nb8 b18\nIf any of these SAF test is fail then the whole FOR is assigned as cloudy. Otherwise clear flag is\nassigned to whole FOR. SAF is followed by final and Individual FOV Flag (IFF). In IFF series of\ntests are applied to individual FOV of a given box.\n(d). Individual FOV Flag (IFF):\nSnow test: This test is daytime test and discriminates between snow and cloud. If visible\nreflectance of FOV is greater than the minimum reflectance (already defined in PAF) and skin\ntemperature is greater than a threshold (275K) then FOV is cloudy otherwise clear. Threshold in\nthis case can be adjusted to any value in the range of 273 to 285 K.\nSecondary stratus test: In this test difference of moisture corrected Tb and Tb is compared with\n7 8\na threshold. The threshold depends on Tb and difference of skin temperature (T ) and surface air\n7 s\ntemperature (T ), both from forecast.\na\nTh = max[ NEÔÅÑT(Ch7), 0.25*(T -T)], here T is calculated using 2 or 3 channels depending on\n2 a s s\ndaytime and nighttime situation.\nÔÅÑTPW=max(Tb ) ‚Äì max(Tb ), in 3x3 pixel FOR\n8 7\nTb (corrected) = Tb + ÔÅÑTPW\n7 7\nCirrus test: If the Tb of FOV under consideration is less than the value of noise corrected Tb\n5 5\nvalue corresponding to FOV having maximum Tb in the given FOR, then the test is said to be\n8\nfailed.\nTb (Noise corrected) = {Tb corresponding to max(Tb )} - 7.0*NEÔÅÑT(Ch#5)\n5 5 8\nFinal skin temperature test:\n[Tb + {Tb ‚Äì Tb } ] < T , then test is assumed to be fail.\n8 8 7 @max(Tb7) s\nIf one FOV passes all the tests then that FOV is upgraded to clear. If FOV fails any of the tests then\nit is flagged as cloudy or partially cloudy depending on the SAF flag.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 95\n8.3.2. Clear-Sky Brightness Temperature computation\nThe CSBT product at for pixel is computed as average of the clear-sky pixel brightness\ntemperatures in the 3x3 FOR centered at the pixel location, if at least 3 clear pixels are found in\nthe FOR. The averaging reduces the impact due to the uncertainty in cloud-detection algorithm as\nwell as reduces the random noise of measurements (NEÔÅÑT) over individual pixels. The land/sea\nflag as well as the clear fraction in the FOR is also computed.

Background\nThe purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Cloud properties such as\ncloud top temperature, cloud top pressure and effective cloud amount from two INSAT-3D thermal\ninfrared window channels (10.5-11.5 ÔÅ≠m, and 11.5-12.5 ÔÅ≠m) and water vapor (6.7 ÔÅ≠m) channels.\nThis document also describes the validation procedure. In this document some background and the\nmethodology employed to derive the cloud top temperature/pressure and effective cloud amount is\ndiscussed. It mainly discusses the theoretical basis and practical aspects of the retrieval algorithm\nfor cloud parameters from INSAT-3D imager channels and outlines the intended validation\napproach with validation results.\nThe cloud properties such as cloud cover, cloud height etc. are very important for various climate\nand weather applications. The clouds at different heights affects weather and climate phenomenon\nin different ways. It is very difficult to imagine variety of weather phenomenon without clouds.\nClouds do not only add beauty and variability in atmosphere but also cause the wide variety of\natmospheric activities. Clouds vary in its appearance, extent, composition and physical properties,\ntherefore, different clouds affect weather and climate differently. For example, rapidly growing\ncumulus clouds are precursor to sever thunderstorm, low water clouds with strong temperature\ninversion results in fog. Thin cirrus clouds do not play a critical role in short to medium range\nweather activities, but they play a very crucial role in earth‚Äôs heat budget and also helps in tracking\nupper level winds. Thin cirrus clouds are thin enough to allow incoming solar radiation to pass\nthrough it but doesn‚Äôt allow outgoing infrared radiation, thus increases the radiative energy and\neventually leads to the warming of earth-atmosphere system.\nCirrus clouds are crucially important to global radiative processes and the heat balance of the Earth;\nthey allow solar heating while reducing infrared radiation to space. Models of climate changes will\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 100\nhave to correctly simulate these clouds to have the proper radiative terms for the Earth's heat\nbudget. Past estimates of the variation of cloud cover and the Earth's outgoing longwave radiation\nhave been derived primarily from the longwave infrared window (10-12 ¬µm) radiances observed\nfrom polar orbiting and geostationary satellites (Rossow and Lacis, 1990; Gruber and Chen, 1988).\nThe occurrence of semi-transparent clouds is often underestimated in these single channel\napproaches. Recently, multispectral techniques have been used to better detect cirrus in global\n(Wylie et al., 2005; Wu and Susskind, 1990) and North American (Wylie and Menzel, 1989) cloud\nstudies.\nAdditionally, clouds are very important to study weather phenomena at various spatial and temporal\nscales including its diurnal cycle. Diurnal cycle of various physical processes such as radiative\nexchange, precipitation, small and large-scale dynamics are of great importance and are greatly\nlinked with clouds, therefore, underlines the study of diurnal cycles of clouds too. Ackerman and\nCox (1981) had reported the diurnal oscillation of cloudiness in some tropical areas. These diurnal\noscillations are part of dynamic-radiative feedback mechanism that operates on various spatial\nscales. (Foltz and Gray, 1979)\n9.3.

Algorithm Functional Specifications\n9.5.1. Overview\nThe cloud top pressure/temperature and cloud effective emissivity from INSAT-3D/3DR imager is\nintended to be retrieved at ~50 km nominal resolution. The cloud products are retrieved at coarser\nresolution than to resolution of actual INSAT-3D/3DR imager observations which are available at\nnominal resolution of ~4 km at nadir. The averaging over a Field of Regard (FOR) of 9x9 pixels\nis used to enhance the signal to noise ratio over cloudy pixels. In general, noise over cloudy pixels\nis higher in comparison to clear pixels, therefore, it becomes essential to take average of observed\nradiances/brightness temperatures to reduce the noise for accurate estimation of cloud properties.\nFor each 9x9 pixel box cloud top pressure, cloud top temperature and effective cloud amount is\nretrieved using Infrared window channel method or water vapor - window intercept method.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 102\nGenerally, window method does not give accurate retrievals over semi-transparent thin high clouds,\ntherefore, water vapor - window intercept method is used over those FOR.\n9.5.2. Infrared Window Channel (WIN) method\nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either\ninfrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast\ntemperature profiles. However, for INSAT-3D/3DR Imager at present only Infrared window\nobservations are used in this method. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud\ntemperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at\nthe target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction\n(NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works\nwell with opaque clouds.\n9.5.3. Water Vapor‚àíInfrared Window Intercept Method (H O)\n2\nCloud top pressure derived with this method are based on the fact that radiances from two different\nspectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of regard at a\nspecified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and opaque cloud\nradiances.\nÔÄ® ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ©\nR N ÔÄΩ 1ÔÄ≠nE R N ÔÄ´nER N,P (1)\ncl bcd c\nOpaque cloud radiance can be calculated from:\np s db ÔÅõ N,T(p) ÔÅù\nR ÔÄ®N,P ÔÄ©ÔÄΩ R ÔÄ®NÔÄ©ÔÄ≠ ÔÉ≤tÔÄ®N,PÔÄ© dp (2)\nbcd c cl dp\np\nc\nWhere, R is the opaque (\"black\") cloud radiance, R is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the\nbcd c1\nfractional transmittance for radiation in spectral band N emitted from the atmospheric layer at\npressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOR covered with cloud,\nPs is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud top pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck radiance of the\nspectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation represents the\nradiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at a pressure level p.\nThis calculation is dependent upon an \"accurate\" estimation of the current atmospheric temperature\nand moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model forecast profile. By comparing the\nobserved radiances with the calculated radiances (for an observed atmosphere defined by the model\nguess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height can be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In\nthe Fig. 1, observed WV and IR radiances at each Field of Regard (FOR) are plotted with the\ncalculated radiances at different heights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The\nstraight line connects the center points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximates the\nobserved surface and cloud conditions.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 103\nFig 1: Measured radiances (mW m‚àí2 sr‚àí1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds (Nieman et al.,\n1993)\nBy extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount is one\n(representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined. The cluster\ndetermination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric Gaussian histogram\nanalysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and it involves ten steps. These steps are outlined\nin detail in Nieman et al. (1993) and Nieman et al. (1997). Calculated water vapor radiances can\nbe in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to calculated\nradiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the calculated\nradiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances obtained using the\nabove equation (2). When the calculated radiances are greater than observed radiances, no\nadjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is due to cloud\ncontamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of water vapor in the\natmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between the IR and WV radiances,\nleading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure value). The NCEP GFS model\nforecast are used here as the guess fields.\nAfter retrieving the value of cloud top pressure effective cloud amount or effective emissivity is\ncomputed using eq (3)\n\u0000 =\n\u0000(\u0000)\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000(\u0000)\n(3)\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000[\u0000,\u0000(\u0000\u0000 )]\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000(\u0000)\nwhere N is the fractional cloud cover within the FOV, \u0000\u0000 the effective cloud amount, ÔÅÆ is the\nwindow channel wavenumber, and \u0000[\u0000,\u0000(\u0000)] , is the opaque cloud radiance corresponding to\n\u0000\nwindow channel frequency and \u0000 (\u0000) is the clear sky radiance corresponding to window channel.\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 104\n9.5.4. Cloud top height and cloud top temperature from cloud top pressure\nThe value of cloud top height, cloud top temperature for INSAT-3D/3DR Imager is derived\ncorresponding to the retrieved cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR Imager. These values are\nagain derived using the aforementioned NCEP forecast profiles. NCEP forecast fields contains the\ntemperature and moisture profiles with pressure levels as its vertical coordinates. Geopotential\nheight formulae is used to compute cloud height for given temperature profile. Geopotential height\n(GPH) is then given by\nR Z\nGPH ÔÄΩ o\nR ÔÄ´Z\no\nWhere R = 6356.766 km, the average radius of the earth.

For window channel method \u0000 = \u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n9.5.6. Radiance bias adjustment\nIt is evident from the previous sections that cloud top properties retrieval algorithm is heavily\ndependent on quality of NCEP forecast fields and the fast forward RT model. If forward simulations\nare not in consonance with observations, then there will be error in the retrieved products. To make\nobservations and forward model simulations consistent, a radiance bias adjustment is necessary\nstep.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 105\nRadiance bias adjustment is carried out by using previous eight days of good quality matchup data\nof INSAT-3D/3DR Imager clear-sky observations and spatially and temporally collocated\nsimulated INSAT-3D/3DR Imager radiances. The simulation is carried out by using NCEP GFS\nanalysis and RTTOV radiative transfer model. In this matchup data set INSAT-3D/3DR clear sky\nobservations are average over 9x9 FOR and only those FOR are selected in which more than 90%\npixels are clear. The radiance bias adjustment is done for land and ocean pixels separately. In\naddition to it, only those points are taken up for matchup data wherein satellite zenith angle is less\nthan 300. An outlier rejection method is also applied before computing radiance bias adjustment\nfactor in terms of slope and offset.\nReferences\nAckerman, S. A., and S. K.

Algorithm Functional Specifications\nIt is very difficult to imagine variety of weather phenomenon without clouds. Clouds do not only\nadd beauty and variability in atmosphere but also cause the wide variety of atmospheric activities.\nClouds very in its appearance, extent, composition and physical properties, therefore, different\nclouds affect weather and climate differently. For example, rapidly growing cumulus clouds are\nprecursor to sever thunderstorm, low water clouds with strong temperature inversion results in fog.\nThin cirrus clouds are not very exciting clouds from short to medium range weather activities but\nplay a very crucial role in earth‚Äôs heat budget and also helps in tracking upper level winds. Thin\ncirrus clouds are thin enough to allow incoming solar radiation to pass through it but doesn‚Äôt allow\noutgoing infrared radiation thus increase the radiative energy and eventually leads to the warming\nof earth-atmosphere system.\nCirrus clouds are crucially important to global radiative processes and the heat balance of the\nEarth; they allow solar heating while reducing infrared radiation to space. Models of climate\nchanges will have to correctly simulate these clouds to have the proper radiative terms for the\nEarth's heat budget. Past estimates of the variation of cloud cover and the Earth's outgoing\nlongwave radiation have been derived primarily from the longwave infrared window (10-12 ÔÅ≠m)\nradiances observed from polar orbiting and geostationary satellites (Rossow and Lacis, 1990;\nGruber and Chen, 1988). The occurrence of semi-transparent clouds is often underestimated in\nthese single channel approaches. Recently, multispectral techniques have been used to better detect\ncirrus in global (Wylie et al., 2005; Wu and Susskind, 1990) and North American (Wylie and\nMenzel, 1989) cloud studies.\nClouds are very important to study at various spatial and temporal scale including its diurnal cycle.\nDiurnal cycle of various physical processes such as radiative exchange, precipitation, small and\nlarge-scale dynamics are of great importance and are greatly linked with clouds, therefore,\nunderlines the study of diurnal cycles of clouds too. Ackerman and Cox (1981) had reported the\ndiurnal oscillation of cloudiness in some tropical areas. These diurnal oscillations are part of\ndynamic-radiative feedback mechanism that operates on various spatial scales (Foltz and Gray,\n1979).\nThe cloud top pressure/temperature and cloud effective emissivity from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder\nis intended to be retrieved at ~50 km nominal resolution. The cloud products are retrieved at\ncoarser resolution than to resolution of actual INSAT-3D/3DR sounder observations which are\navailable at nominal resolution of ~10 km at nadir. The averaging of 5x5 pixels will enhance the\nsignal to noise ratio over cloudy pixels. In general, noise over cloudy pixels is higher in comparison\nto clear pixels, therefore, it becomes essential to take average of observed radiances/brightness\ntemperatures to reduce the noise for accurate estimation of cloud properties.\nCloud properties from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder observations are very important parameters to\nstudy diurnal, seasonal or annual variations in cloud cover as these parameters are available at high\ntemporal resolution at the same geographical location. These parameters could also help in\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 111\nsegregating semi-transparent transmissive clouds (partially transparent to terrestrial radiation)\nopaque clouds in the analysis of cloud cover (Wylie and Menzel, 1989). Similar kind of studies\nare already carried out by Wylie et al. (1994) using NOAA-HIRS observations.\n10.5. Algorithm Theoretical Description\nThis section presents the theoretical basis of the algorithm and practical considerations. Retrieval\nof cloud products (CTP, CTT and effective cloud amount) is a combination of two methods:\nWindow channel method and CO slicing method. Both of these methods require forecast fields of\n2\ntemperature and moisture. The CO slicing method requires the use of radiative transfer model.\n2\nIn this section physics of deriving cloud height and effective cloud amount from INSAT-3D/3DR\nsounder observations is discussed. This sections presents the conceptual framework of retrieval\nalgorithm.\n10.6. Physical Basis of the Cloud Top Pressure/Temperature/Height\nAlgorithm\n10.6.1. CO2 Slicing: Mid- to High-Level Clouds\nThe assumptions made for the application of the CO -slicing algorithm are (Menzel et al., 1992):\n2\n(i) the emissivity of the cloud is the same in all channels used,\n(ii) clouds occur as a single cloud layer,\n(iii) lower cloud layers are ignored, and\n(iv) the surface temperature and the temperature structure of the atmosphere and its\ntransmittance at the used wavelengths are known.\nRetrieval of cloud top pressure and effective cloud amount (i.e., cloud fraction multiplied by cloud\nemittance) are performed using radiances measured in those spectral bands that are located within\nthe broad 15 ÔÅ≠m CO absorption region. The CO slicing technique makes use of combination of\n2 2\n15 ÔÅ≠m CO absorption channels that have different opacity, therefore, sensing different layer of\n2\natmosphere. This helps in assigning height of clouds. The channels of INSAT-3D/3DR used in the\ncloud top pressure and amount algorithm are described in Table 1.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 112\nTable 1: Channel characteristics of INSAT-3D used in cloud top properties retrieval\nINSAT-3D INSAT-3D Channel characteristics Principal Approximate peak in\nChannel Absorbing weighting function\nCentral Bandwidth\nnumber gas\nwavelength ¬µm (cm-1)\n(wavenumber)\n8 10.99 (910) 0.611 (51) Window Surface\n7 11.98 (834) 0.768 (53) Water Vapor Surface\n5 13.33 (750) 0.352 (20) CO Low level atmosphere\n2\n4 13.64 (733) 0.351 (19) CO Mid-level atmosphere\n2\n3 14.03 (713) 0.321 (16) CO Upper level atmosphere\n2\n2 14.31 (699) 0.305 (15) CO Tropopause level\n2\nThe CO2 slicing method is a well-established method and is extensively used for deriving cloud\nproperties from a wide range of GEO and LEO satellite observations. Keeping this fact in mind\nthe latest series of GOES-12/13/14 had a CO channel instead of the split window thermal IR\n2\nchannel. This method is used for deriving cloud top pressure and temperatures from VISSR\nAtmospheric Sounder (VAS) (Menzel and Strabala 1989; Menzel et. al 1992) observations, High\nresolution Infrared Radiometer Sounder (HIRS) (Wylie and Menzel 1999) observations,\nMODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Plantick et al. 2003; Menzel et al.\n2008) radiances and the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) sounder\n(Menzel et al. 1992; Menzel and Purdom 1994) observations. Several sensitivity studies such as\nMenzel et al. (1992) and Baum and Wielicki (1994) have already been carried out to quantify errors\narising from different sources.\nThe CO slicing technique can be understood by calculating the radiances using radiative transfer\n2\nmodels in an atmosphere with a single cloud layer. For a given cloud element in a field of view\n(FOV), i.e. a single sounder pixel, the radiance observed, R(ÔÅÆ), in spectral band ÔÅÆ, can be written\nas:\n\u0000(\u0000) = \u0000\u0000 +(1‚àí\u0000)\u0000 ------------------- (1)\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\nWhere \u0000(\u0000) is observed radiance in band ÔÅÆ, N is the fractional cloud coverage, \u0000 is radiance\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\nfrom clear portion and \u0000 is radiance from the cloud covered portion.\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\nCloud covered radiance can be written as:\n\u0000 = \u0000\u0000 +(1‚àí\u0000)\u0000 ------------------- (2)\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\nWhere \u0000 is the emissivity of cloud and \u0000 is radiance from the opaque cloud.\n\u0000\u0000\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 113\nBy combining Eq (1) and Eq (2) we get:\n\u0000(\u0000) = (1‚àí\u0000\u0000)\u0000 (\u0000)+\u0000\u0000\u0000 (\u0000) ------------------- (3)\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\nNow from radiative transfer equation \u0000 and \u0000 are given as:\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000 = \u0000(\u0000 )\u0000(\u0000 )‚àí‚à´\n\u0000\u0000\u0000(\u0000,\u0000) \u0000\u0000[\u0000,\u0000(\u0000)]\n\u0000\u0000 ------------------- (4)\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\n\u0000 = \u0000(\u0000 )\u0000(\u0000 )‚àí‚à´\n\u0000\u0000\u0000(\u0000,\u0000) \u0000\u0000[\u0000,\u0000(\u0000)]\n\u0000\u0000 ------------------- (5)\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\nWhere \u0000 is the surface pressure, \u0000 is pressure corresponding to the top of single level cloud,\n\u0000 \u0000\n\u0000(\u0000,\u0000) is the top of the atmosphere (p = 0) transmittance of radiation of spectral band ÔÅÆ emitted\nfrom the atmospheric level at pressure p, and \u0000[\u0000,\u0000(\u0000)] is the Planck radiance for spectral band\nÔÅÆÔÄ†for temperature T at pressure level p. Thus first terms of Eq (4) and (5) represents the contribution\nto radiance from the surface term (which is cloud top in Eq (4) and surface in Eq(5)), whereas, the\nsecond term represents the absorption of radiation by atmosphere above the surface or cloud top.\nThese equations neglect the scattering by clouds or atmosphere which is very valid assumptions\nfor clear atmosphere and opaque clouds at the desired sounder spectral bands.\nNow expanding above equations by integrating by parts and solving we get:\n\u0000 (\u0000,\u0000) = \u0000 (\u0000)‚àí‚à´\n\u0000\u0000\u0000(\u0000,\u0000) \u0000\u0000[\u0000,\u0000(\u0000)]\n\u0000\u0000 ------------------- (6)\n\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\nNow by substituting Eq (6) in Eq (3) we get:\n\u0000(\u0000)‚àí\u0000 (\u0000) = \u0000\u0000‚à´\n\u0000\u0000\u0000(\u0000,\u0000) \u0000\u0000[\u0000,\u0000(\u0000)]\n\u0000\u0000 ------------------- (7)\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\nThis is the basic equation used in CO slicing method. It is evident from the Eq (7) that with the\n2\nhelp of a-priori information of \u0000 (\u0000) and \u0000(\u0000,\u0000), value of \u0000 that is cloud top pressure could be\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\ninferred. However, even with this a-priori information, there are two unknowns (\u0000\u0000 and \u0000 ) in Eq\n\u0000\n(7). To solve this problem, the ratio of Eq (7) for two observations made in nearby spectral bands\nis taken. Thus radiance ratios between two spectral bands in similar frequencies (Chahine, 1974;\nSmith and Platt, 1978) gives the information of cloud top pressure.\nThe ratio of the deviations in observed radiances, R(ÔÅÆ) to their corresponding clear-sky radiances,\n\u0000 (\u0000) for two spectral bands of frequency \u0000 and \u0000 viewing the same FOV is written as\n\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\n\u0000(\u0000\u0000 )\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000(\u0000\u0000) = \u0000\u0000\u0000‚à´ \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000(\u0000\u0000,\u0000) \u0000\u0000[\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 ,\u0000(\u0000)] \u0000\u0000 ------------------- (8)\n\u0000(\u0000\u0000 )\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000(\u0000\u0000) \u0000\u0000\u0000‚à´\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\u0000(\u0000\u0000,\u0000) \u0000\u0000[\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n,\u0000(\u0000)] \u0000\u0000\nAs it is already stated that channels with wavenumber (or wavelength) that are very similar in\nwavenumber (wavelength) are taken to satisfy the assumption that cloud emissivities in both\nchannels are same that is \u0000 is approximately equal to \u0000 . With this assumption we are left with\n\u0000 \u0000\nonly one unknown in Eq (8) and that can be easily estimated.\nAfter retrieving the value of cloud top pressure using a-priori information of \u0000 (\u0000) and \u0000(\u0000,\u0000)\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\nin eq (8), effective cloud amount or effective emissivity is computed using eq (9)\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 114\n\u0000(\u0000)\u0000\u0000 (\u0000)\n\u0000\u0000 = \u0000\u0000\u0000 ------------------- (9)\n\u0000[\u0000,\u0000(\u0000\u0000 )]\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n(\u0000)\nwhere N is the fractional cloud cover within the FOV, \u0000\u0000 the effective cloud amount, ÔÅÆ is the\nwindow channel wavenumber, and \u0000[\u0000,\u0000(\u0000)] , is the opaque cloud radiance corresponding to\n\u0000\nwindow channel frequency and \u0000 (\u0000) is the clear sky radiance corresponding to window channel.\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\nIt is evident from the equation (9) that effective cloud amount or effective cloud emissivity is\nmultiplication of N (fractional cloud cover within the FOV) and ÔÅ• (Cloud emissivity), therefore,\neffective cloud amount can be less than 1 because of:\nbroken cloud (N<1, ÔÅ•=1) has filled the FOV\novercast transmissive cloud (N=1, ÔÅ•<1)\nbroken transmissive cloud (N<1, ÔÅ•<1)\nTherefore, it is difficult to quantify exactly the emissivity of clouds using the effective cloud\namounts from approximately 50 km x 50 km INSAT-3D/3DR sounder products.\nThe cloud top products from CO slicing technique are matched with other methods to filter out\n2\nany other clouds that are not upper level clouds. Upper level clouds are flagged by using the\ncombination of highly absorbing channels (such as water vapor absorption channel in 6.7 ¬µm or\nCO absorption channel in 15 ¬µm band) and channels with less absorption. In general, the\n2\nbrightness temperatures in strong absorption channels are much cooler than the brightness\ntemperatures (BT) in weak absorption channels for clear atmospheric condition or low level\nclouds. Contrary to this, for high level clouds BT in strong absorption channel is warmer than the\nweak absorption channels (Soden and Bretherton, 1993; Schmetz et al., 1997). Appropriate\nthresholds were taken to identify the high level clouds in INSAT-3D/3DR cloud top retrieval\nalgorithm. In present algorithm 14.03 ¬µm (channel 3) and 13.33 ¬µm (channel 5) of INSAT-3D/3DR\nsounder are used for this purpose. If BT of ch#3 is greater than the BT of ch#5 by a given threshold,\nthen the cloud is assumed to be high cloud and cloud top pressure from CO slicing method is\n2\nretained.\nEquation (8) is used to retrieve cloud top pressure for a 5 x 5 FOR. The left side of Equation (8)\ncontains the terms for observed radiances as well as clear radiances. The value of observed\nradiances is calculated by taking the average of cloudy pixels within 5x5 FOR. Cloud top\ncomputation is carried out only if 16 or more cloudy pixels are found within 5x5 box. Computation\nof clear sky radiances and transmittances is carried out using a fast forward radiative transfer model\ncalled RTTOV (Eyre 1991; Saunders et al. 1999; Matricardi et al 2001) developed at European\nCenter for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). RTTOV uses the Pressure Layer\nOptical Depth algorithm (Hannon et al 1996). This model is very flexible and can take any number\nof pressure levels for forward model computation, however, internally it interpolates atmospheric\nprofiles to fixed 43 pressure levels ranging from 1013 to 0.1 hPa. This interpolation is done because\nfast forward coefficients for INSAT-3D/3DR sounder SRFs are derived on given 43 pressure\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 115\nlevels. The forward calculations from RTTOV takes satellite zenith angle, absorption by well-\nmixed gases (including nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide), water vapor (including the water\nvapor continuum), and ozone into account. The forecast field from NCEP containing temperature,\nmoisture profiles, surface air temperature, skin temperature etc. are used to simulate clear sky\ntransmittances and radiances.\nThe right hand side of Equation (8) uses aforementioned transmittance profiles. Integration is\ncarried out by using trapzoidal method wherein integration limit is bounded by surface pressure\nand tropopause pressure level.\nFor the retrieval of cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder a ‚Äútop-down‚Äù approach,\nsimilar to MODIS cloud top pressure retrieval method is followed. In this approach pair of two\nchannels are selected based on their decreasing opacity. If retrieval of cloud top pressure is\nsuccessful for a given pair, then there will no need for applying eq (8) for other pair of channels\nwhich are relatively less opaque. For INSAT-3D/3DR sounder first pair of ch#2 and ch#3 are taken\nwhich are considered to be the most opaque channels for CO slicing method. If eq (8)\n2\nappropriately converges for this pair, then retrieval is considered to be successful, otherwise the\nsame procedure is repeated with pairs of (ch#3, ch#4) or (ch#4, ch#5). If none of these pairs are\nable to give value of cloud top pressure, then window channel method is used for retrieval of cloud\ntop pressure.\n10.6.2. Window Channel method for cloud top pressure for low to mid clouds\nIn this method the cloud top pressure is carried out by comparing infrared window channel\nbrightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature profiles. A 6-h NWP\nmodel forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast\nSystem (GFS) is the source of temperature profile (GFS; Derber et al. 1991). This method assumes\nthat clouds are overcast and non-transmissive (ÔÅ•=1). Generally, cloud top temperatures/pressure\nof low level overcast clouds are determined by using window channel method. In addition to it,\nwherein, cloud top pressure is not determined by CO slicing method, window channel method is\n2\nused to retrieve cloud top properties for those pixels too. In this method cloud top pressure is\ndetermined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average of BT cloudy pixels in 5x5\nFOR, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. The cloud emissivity is assumed\nto be unity and NÔÅ•=N /25.\nc\nFinally, all cloudy FORs are assigned a cloud top pressure either by CO slicing or infrared window\n2\ntechnique.\n10.7. Cloud top height and cloud top temperature from cloud top pressure\nThe value of cloud top height and cloud top temperature for INSAT-3D/3DR sounder are derived\ncorresponding to the retrieved cloud top pressure from INSAT-3D/3DR sounder. These values are\nagain derived using the aforementioned NCEP forecast profiles. NCEP forecast fields contains the\ntemperature and moisture profiles with pressure levels as its vertical coordinates. Geopotential\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 116\nheight formulae is used to compute cloud height for given temperature profile. Geopotential height\n(GPH) is then given by\nR Z\nGPH ÔÄΩ o ---------- (10)\nR ÔÄ´Z\no\nWhere R = 6356.766 km, the average radius of the earth. For given pressure, temperature and\no\nhumidity profile from surface to 0.1 hPa, height of any pressure level or thickness of atmospheric\nlayer from surface to a particular pressure level can be computed using the formula\nR T P\nZ ÔÄΩ d v ln( s) --------- (11)\ng P\nP ‚Äì Surface Pressure, P ‚Äì Given pressure where geopotential height is to be calculated, T - Layer\ns\nv\nmean virtual temperature. This can be computed at all the retrieved pressure levels.\nVirtual temperature T is given by T ÔÄΩ(1ÔÄ´0.61q)T where q is specific humidity expressed in\nv v\nKg/Kg, T is temperature in K.\n10.8. Radiance bias adjustment\nIt is evident from the previous sections that cloud top properties retrieval algorithm is heavily\ndependent on quality of NCEP forecast fields and fast forward RT model. If forward simulations\nare not in consonance with observations, then there will be error in retrieved products. To make\nobservations and forward model simulations consistent, radiance bias adjustment is a necessary\nstep.\nRadiance bias adjustment is carried out by previous eight days of good quality matchup data of\nINSAT-3D/3DR sounder clear-sky sounder observations and spatially and temporally collocated\nsimulated INSAT-3D/3DR sounder radiances. The simulation is carried out by using NCEP GFS\nanalysis and RTTOV radiative transfer model. In this matchup data set INSAT-3D/3DR clear sky\nobservations are average over 5x5 FOR and only those FOR are selected in which more than 90%\npixels are clear. The radiance bias adjustment is done for land and ocean pixels separately. In\naddition to it, only those points are taken up for matchup data wherein satellite zenith angle is less\nthan 300. An outlier rejection method is also applied before computing radiance bias adjustment\nfactor in terms of slope and offset.\nReferences\nAckerman, S. A., and S. K.

Introduction\nIn this document, we offer some background to the cloud microphysics retrieval over oceans using\nINSAT-3D imager data, describe the theoretical basis of the cloud microphysics retrieval\nalgorithm, discuss inputs required, output deliverables and the practical aspects of the algorithm\nimplementation, the technical issues and the future scope.\n11.3. Overview and Background\nClouds are suspension of tiny water droplets or ice crystals. They are of varying sizes and shapes.\nThey can be of water, ice or mixed phase. The size of cloud droplets is of the order of 10 ¬µm.\nClouds strongly modulate the Earths energy balance and its atmosphere through their interaction\nwith the solar and terrestrial radiation (Roebeling et al., 2005). Their impact on the radiation budget\ncan result in a heating or cooling of the planet, depending on the radiative properties of the cloud\nand their altitude (Stephens et al., 1981). The radiative properties of the clouds depend upon the\nvarious cloud microphysical parameters which includes optical depth, effective particle radius,\nthermodynamic phase etc. Clouds interact with radiation in many ways like scattering, emission,\nabsorption and this interaction is sensitive towards each of the microphysical parameters. The\ntemporal monitoring of cloud-top microphysics is of extreme importance in the precipitation\ndevelopment processes. The retrieval of cloud microphysical properties like effective radius,\noptical depth, thermodynamic phase etc. from INSAT 3D has been made possible due to the\ninclusion of 1.6(cid:0)m channel in INSAT 3D imager. This is a major enhancement as compared to\nthe derivation of only the cloud top temperature from Kalpana VHRR. Earlier studies show that\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 121\nthe simulation of convective systems is very sensitive to the parameterization of cloud\nmicrophysics. Thus retrieval of the microphysical parameters from INSAT 3D aids in monitoring\nand accurate prediction of convective weather events. The cloud-microphysical parameters at high\ntemporal resolution will be very helpful in tracking the evolution of local as well as mesoscale\nsystems.\nThe sensitivity of different microphysical parameters to different regions of electromagnetic\nspectrum can be studied with the help of a radiative transfer (RT) model. A Radiative transfer\nmodel (RTM) computes the radiative transfer of the electromagnetic radiation through the\natmosphere. The retrieval of cloud microphysical properties is done with the help of an RT model\nusing the imager channels of INSAT-3D. The INSAT-3D channels which may be used for cloud\nproperties retrieval includes Visible (0.65¬µm) and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR-1.66¬µm). The\nimportance of retrieving the optical thickness and effective radius derives not only from the fact\nthat such a retrieval is possible, but from the fact that shortwave cloud radiative properties depend\nalmost exclusively on these two parameters.\n11.4. Objective\nThe main objective of this document is to provide step wise algorithm, inputs and outputs as\nexpected from the INSAT-3D cloud microphysical product. This document will form the basis of\noperational implementation of the algorithm.\n11.5. Inputs\nInputs to the algorithm will include geo-referenced, corrected Albedo, Digital counts for Visible\nchannel and SWIR along with satellite viewing geometry (solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle,\nazimuth angle).\n11.5.1. Static data\nThis will consist of the Look-up Table (LUT) which is generated using a RT model and stored. A\nrandom dataset of cloud microphysical parameters with solar geometry is also stored as static file.\nThese files will be required by the inversion model.\n11.5.2.

Overview\nThe underlying principle on which the retrieval of these microphysical parameters is based is the\nfact that the reflection function of clouds in the visible band is primarily a function of the cloud\noptical thickness, whereas the reflection function at a water (or ice) absorbing band in the\nshortwave infrared (SWIR) is primarily a function of cloud particle size.\n11.6.2. Theoretical Background\nThe visible (0.7¬µm) channel is a non-absorbing channel; the reflectance depends only upon the\ncloud optical depth. Hence, there is a very significant difference between the radiances of very\nthick clouds and thin clouds in the visible spectrum. The radiance values are higher for very thick\nclouds as compared to thin clouds. This kind of behaviour indicates a pronounced effect of optical\ndepth on the visible portion of the spectrum. For the SWIR bands, the droplet absorption increases\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 123\napproximately linearly with effective radius, and hence the asymptotic reflectance of a cloud\ndecreases with increasing particle size. Thus the visible band contains information primarily\nregarding cloud optical thickness, whereas the absorbing bands eventually reach an optical\nthickness where they are primarily dependent on particle size alone. A combination of visible and\nshortwave-infrared absorbing bands therefore provides information on both optical thickness and\neffective radius.\n11.6.3. Algorithm Overview\nTo retrieve the cloud optical thickness (œÑ ) and effective particle radius (r ), a radiative transfer\nc e\nmodel was first used to compute the reflected intensity field. The values of the reflection function\nwere stored for different combinations of cloud optical thickness and particle size at three\ngeometrical angles in the form of a look-up-table. The determination of optical thickness and cloud\neffective radius from spectral reflectance measurements constitutes the inverse problem. This has\nbeen solved by comparing the measured reflectances of INSAT-3D visible and SWIR channels\nwith entries in the lookup table (LUT) and searching for the combination of œÑ and r that gives the\nc e\nbest fit.\nIn the present case, we have used SBDART (Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative\ntransfer) radiative transfer model for computing the LUT. SBADART computes plane parallel\nradiative transfer in clear and homogeneous cloudy conditions within the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere for\nthe region from 0-50,000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 (Ricchiazzi et al.,1998). SBDART can compute the radiative\neffects of several lower and upper atmosphere aerosol types. The radiative transfer equation is\nnumerically integrated with DISORT. This module was designed to treat the plane parallel\nradiative transfer. The discrete ordinate method provides a stable algorithm to calculate the plane\nparallel radiative transfer equation in vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere. SBDART contains\npre-computed scattering parameters for the effective radii in the 2-128Œºm range. In order to\ncompute the radiative transfer through the cirrus clouds, it also includes scattering parameters of\nspherical ice grains for single size distribution. SBDART computes intensity of scattered and\nthermally emitted radiation at different heights. It allows up to 50 atmospheric layers and 20\nradiation streams.\nThe determination of cloud optical depth and cloud effective radius from spectral reflectance\nmeasurements constitutes the inverse problem and is typically solved by comparing the measured\nreflectances with entries in a lookup table and searching for the combination of œÑ and re that gives\nc\nthe best fit (Twomey and Cocks 1982, 1989).\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 124\n11.6.4.

Introduction\nThe purpose of this document is to present the methodology for deriving 5-day composite maps\nusing Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) from INSAT-3D/3DR at different broad atmospheric\nlevels. The out of six imager channels in INSAT-3D/3DR, AMVs are derived using four channels\nand they are: i) Visible (VIS) covering [0.55 ‚Äì 0.75 ¬µm], ii) Mid-wave Infrared (MIR) covering\n[3.8 ‚Äì 4.0¬µm], iii) Water Vapor (WV) covering [6.5 ‚Äì 7.1 ¬µm] and iv) Thermal Infrared (TIR1)\ncovering [10.2 ‚Äì 11.3 ¬µm] ranges of spectrum respectively. In this document some background\nand general characteristic of different AMV-derived products; the methodology employed to\nderive the 5-day composite maps are presented.\n12.3. Overview and background\nThe Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) derived by considering the movement of cloud and\nwater vapour tracers in successive images of geostationary satellites (Nieman et al., 1997; Velden\net al., 1997; Schmetz et al., 1993; Kishtawal et al. 2009) are considered as one of the most reliable\nsource of wind information with higher spatial-temporal coverage over the ocean as well as land\nregions.The AMVs is one of the important inputs to the global and regional assimilation systems\nfor the improvement of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). The role of AMVs is particularly\nsignificant over the oceans and high latitudes where in-situ observations are scarce. The vertical\ncoverage of AMVs spreads through high to low-levels as per the channel used during retrieval viz.\nAMV retrieved using: i) infrared channel data covers entire ranges of atmosphere i.e. from 100-\n950 hPa, ii) water vapour channel data covers only high-level i.e. from 100-500 hPa, while iii)\nvisible and mid-infrared channel data covers low-levels i.e. from 600-950 hPa respectively. 5-Day\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 130\ncomposite winds maps derived using the retrieved AMVs in three broad atmospheric levels are\nvery useful for monitoring of monsoon flows over Indian region. The following Fig-1 shows an\nexample of weekly low-level monsoon flow for the weeks viz. 01-07 July 2017 and 08-14 July\n2017 respectively.\nFigure-1: Low-level (701 - 950 hPa) weekly monsoon flow derived using visible AMVs for the\nweeks 01-07 July 2017 and 08-14 July 2017 respectively.\nThis type of 5-day composite wind map derived from AMVs can be used to monitor the progress\nof monsoon on operational basis.\n12.4. Objective\nThe main objective of this study is to discuss the procedure for deriving the 5-day composite wind\nmaps derived using atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) retrieved from INSAT-3D/3DR over\nland and sea at every half-hour interval.

Methodology\nTo compute 5-day composite of AMV maps for three broad atmospheric levels (high, mid and low-\nlevels), retrieved scattered AMVs, available at 30-minutes interval, are gridded into 0.5 degree x\n0.5 degree horizontal resolution covering the ares 0E-130E, 50S-50N and by taking 50 hPa vertical\ndifference. The vertical pressure levels considered in this case are: 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350,\n400, 450, 500, 550, 600, 650, 700, 750, 800, 850, 900, 950 hPa respectively. Where-ever AMV is\nnot available an undefined value of -999 are assigned to the grid point. Once gridded AMV at\nevery 30-minute interval is generated, 5-day composite maps are generated by taking average of\nall available AMVs for a particular grid point.\ni) High-level Map: Gridded AMVs available in the levels 100 hPa to 400 hPa are averaged for\n5-Day to generate 5-Day composite High-level Map.\nii) Mid-level Map: Gridded AMVs available in the levels 401 hPa to 700 hPa are averaged for\n5-Day to generate 5-Day composite mid-level Map.\niii) Low-level Map: Gridded AMVs available in the levels 701 hPa to 950 hPa are averaged for\n5-Day to generated 5-Day composite low-level Map\n12.6.2.

In this document some background and general\ncharacteristic of satellite-derived winds from visible channels and INSAT-3DR visible channel\ncharacteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and\npractical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach.\n13.2.1. Overview and background\nSpatio‚Äìtemporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical\nweather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of\ngeostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed time\ninterval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the cloud\nmass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector studies and spatio‚Äì\ntemporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatio‚Äìtemporal life cycle includes the generation,\ndissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a sequence of geostationary satellite\nimages. During the 1970‚Äôs and early 1980‚Äôs, cloud motion winds were produced in major\noperational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service)\nusing a combination of automated and manual techniques. Early automated techniques supplied\nquality low-level vectors from visible channels but often yielded in consistent quality for mid- and\nhigh-level motions. Height assignment for the visible winds is done with collocated infrared\nimages using infrared window technique. In the subsequent years, due to the developments in\nimage-processing and pattern recognition techniques (Merill et al., 1991), it was possible to design\nfully automatic techniques for wind retrieval, and NESDIS began its application in 1992. In later\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 135\ntime, several new developments were made to make accurate retrievals of winds from satellite\nimages.\n13.2.2. Objective\nThe main objective of this study is to derive the High Resolution Visible Winds (HRVIS) over sea\nusing multiple successive half hourly High resolution visible images. The region over which the\nwinds are derived should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point.\n13.3.

Algorithm Functional Specifications\n13.4.1. Tracer selection:\nAt the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial cloud\nfeatures are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target domain and\ncomputing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any gradients greater\nthan 15¬∞ K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also undergo a spatial coherence\nanalysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted targets. Water vapor tracers are\ngenerally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in a template of specified size and\ncompared with empirically determined thresholds to identify the features with sufficient variability\n(Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold value are identified as tracers for cloud-free\nenvironments. The pixel with maximum bi-directional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the\nEuropean Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers\nin the Meteosat (first-generation satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram\nanalysis (Tomassini, 1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the\nselected templates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter\nthe image, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by\ncomputing local image anomaly in a 24 x 24 template window (in pixel), both in cloudy regions\nof the visible images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula:\na ÔÄΩÔÉ•ÔÉ• I(i, j)ÔÄ≠I (1)\ni j\nÔÄ® ÔÄ©\nWhere I i, j represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents the\nmean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally produced by a\nsmooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This difference can help in\nreducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008).\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 137\n13.4.2. Height assignment\nThe height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are derived\nusing the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz. such as the\ninfrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). Once final\nheight is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is\nfollowing:\n(a) Infrared Window Channel (WIN):\nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing either\ninfrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast temperature\nprofiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature, which is an average\nof coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the target location. A 6-h NWP\nmodel forecast from National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast\nSystem (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds.\nHowever, movement of opaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion\nat the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed.\n(b) Cloud Base Method (BASE):\nWind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or altitudes\nlower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the cloud base\nlevel instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A method was developed\nat the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to estimate this height using the\nInfrared Window channel. This method first constructs a histogram of the BT values over a selected\nregion surrounding the cloud target being examined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite\npolynomials are fitted to the histogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy\nand clear sky region. Assuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be\nestimated. The mid cloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram\nof the cloudy distribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest\n5% of the cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same\ndistance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud base\ntemperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target location. As\nmentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those targets which are\ncalculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude lower than 600 hPa).\nThis \"initial\" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous Infrared Window height\nassignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these winds, and is not utilized for\nwater vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa (i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa).\nOnce the visible tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, the best\nheight among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) value of\nall the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a specific visible\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 138\ntracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the BASE height is used as\nthe final height. Once the final height using the above height assignment method is established,\nthe pressure height is optimized using minimized differences with first guess winds up to 75 hPa\nin upwards and downwards directions.\n13.4.3. Tracking\nIf a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected tracers\nare estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a bigger ‚Äò‚Äòsearch\nwindow‚Äô‚Äô, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize the search window size,\nthe first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also considered. The search area is\noptimized within ¬±30 degree from the model wind direction at that level of atmosphere. The 24 X\n24 template (in pixel) in the second image that lies within the search window should have the same\nclass as the template in the first image; otherwise the template in the second window is rejected.\nThe cross-correlation technique is used operationally for tracking the tracer between two images\nin most operational centers. However, in this study the degrees of matching between two\nsuccessive images are calculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970)\ncoefficient (E). It is defined as\nn\nÔÉ•ÔÄ®\nI ÔÄ≠I\nÔÄ©2\nt s\nE ÔÄΩ 1 ÔÄ≠ iÔÄΩ1 (2)\nn\nÔÉ•\nÔÄ®\nI ÔÄ≠I\nÔÄ©2\nt t\niÔÄΩ1\nWhere I and I are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window and\nt s\nI is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 24 x 24 (in pixel) and this is the size\nt\nof template window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of the\nsearching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64 (in pixel). The coefficient E is\nnormalized to values between ‚Äì‚àû and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match, E =\n0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E< 0 implies the\nlack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model efficiency to 1, the\nmore accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of E=0.8 is defined, below\nwhich a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E)\nis normalized and its value lies between -‚àû and 1, towards the higher end (e.g. as E‚Üí 1.0), the\nvalue of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation coefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly\nequivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two objects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the\nbest fit for tracking. One of the main advantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the\npossibility of multiple maxima, because the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences\nbetween two features compared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the\ndegree of mismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to\nthat of MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 139\nmethod in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean\nregion (Deb et al., 2008).\n13.4.4. Wind buffer generation and Quality control\nQuality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the\ncoherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the AMVs are\nderived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the retrieved winds are\ndone either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at EUMETSAT or through\n3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS (Nieman et al., 1997) or both the\nalgorithms together. In the present study a new technique of wind buffer generation and\nsubsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed. In this technique, a wind buffer\nis created using previous three images between a pair of images (viz. between 1-2 and 2-3) and\nstored in a file (Fig. 1). The previous three images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-\nhour decorrelation timescale during retrieval. In quality control procedure consists of a coherence\nanalysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of coherence\ncomputed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality flag falls sharply\nby an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its surroundings increases.\nHere each vector wind is represented by a complex numberVc ÔÄΩu ÔÄ´iv . For every new vector\ni,j i,j i,j\nunder consideration, (from current image-pair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed\nat the same as well as 3 X 3 neighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show\nsimilar brightness characteristics (to maintain the similar height).\nFig 1: A schematic diagram of quality control process.\nHere X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration and\nO (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors. The vector differences\n(magnitude of complex numbers) are calculated as ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ ÔÄΩVc ÔÄ≠ÔÅªVÔÅΩ . Here Vc represents the\ndif i,j,t i,j,t\ncurrent vector at (i, j) point and\nÔÅªVÔÅΩ\nneighborhood vectors with ÔÄ≠1ÔÇ£i ÔÇ£1,ÔÄ≠1ÔÇ£ j ÔÇ£1 and\ni,j,t\ntemporal scale t varies from 1 to 3. If all spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors are present,\nthen the difference set will contain 27 vectors (9 spatial neighborhoods with 3 temporal scales).\nHowever, all vectors may not be there all the times. The quality control process begins if at least\n10 vector differencesV , excluding the difference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in\ndif\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 140\nÔÅª ÔÅΩ\nthe set. In the next step, set of vector differences V is arranged in ascending order. The quality\ndif\ncontrol process begins is the average of 10 V is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI\ndif\nvalue for each vector is determined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are\nperformed, which is normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A\nweighted average of these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality\nvectors from final output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of\nrejecting, search process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not\npresent it goes to next previous times steps and so on.\nIf S is the mean ‚Äúspeed‚Äù of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different quality\nfunctions are computed as below:\nDirection Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑÔÅ± ÔÉπ 1\nDCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nÔÉ´ A exp(ÔÄ≠S/B )ÔÄ´C ÔÉª\n1 1 1\nSpeed Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑS ÔÉπ 2\nSCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nÔÉ´ MAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C ÔÉª\n2 2 2\nVector Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑV ÔÉπ 3\nVCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n3 3 3\nSpacial Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑV ÔÉπ 4\nPCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( m )\nÔÉ∫\nÔÉ´ MAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C ÔÉª\n4 4 2\nIn the above formulation, ÔÅÑÔÅ±,ÔÅÑS,ÔÅÑV represent the difference of direction (degrees), difference of\nspeed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite wind component.\nÔÅÑV is the length of difference vector between satellite wind component and its best neighbor.\nm\nThe best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference.

Hundreds of\n‚Äúisolated‚Äù vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real situation. In the current\nmethod, the vector under consideration receives support from the past eight images. This method\nproduces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level and captures upper-level meridional\nflow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly, if we take three satellite images each with\n30-minute interval stating at 02:30 UTC to 03:30 UTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair\nare stored as buffer in a file and represented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer\ngenerated at 03:30 UTC is used for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00\nUTC images and the second image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For\nexample, winds retrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is\ngiven as 04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires four\nimages. Similarly, the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and\nprocess is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of valid\nretrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently.\n13.5. Operational Implementation\nStep 1: Tracer selection from image\nÔÇ∑ Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly surrounding\neach pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness temperature of the\nwindow.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 142\nStep 2: Height assignment\nÔÇ∑ Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique.

Validation\n13.7.1. Data required\nParameter Type Source\nWind Collocated Radiosonde Profiles IMD\n13.7.2. Methods of validation\nThe evaluation of HRVIS winds should be taken into both qualitative and quantitative measures.\nQuantitative assessment of the HRVIS winds product is possible from statistical analyses and\nimpact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching observations with collocated\nradiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS winds evaluation\nreporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of product quality over time and\ncan be employed in determining observation weight in objective data assimilation. At the CGMS\nXXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational\nwind production quality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The\nrecommended three parts to the report.\ni) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and satellite winds\nfor low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) levels together with the\nradiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for three latitude bands: north of 20 N, the\ntropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S.\nii) Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water vapor motion\nvectors through the last 12 months.\niii) Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm.\nThe vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated radiosonde\nreport used for verification is given by\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 144\n\u0000\n(\u0000\u0000) = [(\u0000 ‚àí \u0000 )\u0000 + (\u0000 ‚àí \u0000)\u0000]\u0000\n\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\nThe speed bias is given by\n\u0000\n1 \u0000 \u0000\n(\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000) = \u0000[(\u0000\u0000 + \u0000\u0000)\u0000 ‚àí (\u0000 \u0000 + \u0000\u0000)\u0000]\n\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\nThe mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is\n\u0000\n1\n(\u0000\u0000\u0000) = \u0000(\u0000\u0000)\n\u0000 \u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\nAnd the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally reported is\n\u0000\n1 \u0000\n(\u0000\u0000) = [ \u0000((\u0000\u0000) ‚àí(\u0000\u0000\u0000))\u0000]\u0000\n\u0000 \u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\nThe root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum of the\nsquares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean vector difference,\n\u0000\n(\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000) = [(\u0000\u0000\u0000)\u0000+ (\u0000\u0000)\u0000]\u0000\nIt must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the mean\ncomponent difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the\ndeviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector.\n\u0000\n(‚àÜ\u0000\u0000) = \u0000(\u0000 ‚àí \u0000 )\u0000\n\u0000 \u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\n\u0000\n(‚àÜ\u0000\u0000) = \u0000(\u0000 ‚àí \u0000)\u0000\n\u0000 \u0000\n\u0000\u0000\u0000\nTo avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean vector\ndifference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to CGMS\nguideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should be 7m/s\nrespectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of winds should\nbe about zero.\n13.8. Technical Issues (Limitations etc.)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the\nregistration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However, the\nfollowing limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind.However, the retrieved vectors\nin regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-\nable information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 145\nindividual vectors represent single level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles are\npossible by using multi-spectral observations.\na) Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed retrieval\nThis sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different vertical levels as\nwell as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity of atmospheric jets, the\nretrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in the assigned pressure levels. Based\non some standard analysis (e.g. NCEP reanalysis of 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a\nquantitative assessment of the vertical and spatial structure of this sensitivity.\nb) Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment\nWe plan to use IMD‚Äôs operational regional model output during height assignment procedure.\nHowever, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of AMV retrieval, either\nIMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational model, or a lower-quality solution\nbased on the output of coarser-resolution GCM will be generated over the regions not covered by\nIMD‚Äôs regional model.\nc) Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment\nTo use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to find the\noptimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may increase the AMV turn-\naround time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway to develop an empirical version of\nRT model that can be used for simulation of IR and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of\ncloud heights. The inverse of this empirical model will then be used in real-time applications.\nd) Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods for tracking of\ncloud-tracers.\nThe comparison has been made for a large number of image samples and it was found that the\nefficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum cross correlation (MCC)\nmethods are comparable, while the MDM method is significantly faster than MCC.\nReferences\nBedka KM, Mecikalski JR (2005) Application of satellite-derived atmospheric motion vectors for\nestimating meso-scale flows.

Deb\nStaggered AMV Baseline\nC.M. Kishtawal\nDocument\n14.2. Introduction\nThe geostationary satellite derived winds, also known as Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) are\nconsidered as one of the most reliable source of wind information over oceanic region where\nnormal ground based observations are very rare. Presently in India operationally AMVs are\navailable from two advanced meteorological satellites INSAT-3D (Deb et al., 2016, Kishtawal et\nal., 2009) and INSAT-3DR using consecutive 30-minutes images (www.mosdac.gov.in). It is also\nwell established that assimilation of AMVs in the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model\nleads to significant improvement in the weather forecast (Deb et al, 2010; Kaur et al., 2015; Kumar\net al. 2016) over the Indian Ocean region. The purpose of this document is to present an algorithm\nfor retrieving Atmospheric Motion Vectors (AMVs) from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR in\nstaggering mode and its validation procedure. The INSAT-3D/3DR have two IR window channels\n(10.5-11.5Œº and 11.5-12.5 Œº). In this document some background and general characteristic of\nsatellite-derived AMV and INSAT-3D/3DR IR channel characteristics; the methodology employed\nto derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the\nplanned validation approach.\n14.2.1. Overview and background\nThe availability of data from both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR with similar spectral characteristic\nand region of interest, at every 15-minutes has motivated us to re-look further for the improvement\nin retrieval algorithm to get better quality AMVs over the Indian Ocean region. The specific reason\nfor this motivation is that in stead of using 30-minute images for winds retrieval, the accuracy of\nwinds will improve if shorter spatio-temporal images are used during the retrieval. For example,\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 150\nif INSAT-3D captured image at 0000 UTC, then INSAT-3DR does at 0015 UTC and similar\nnomenclature follows for other time of the day. The operational meteorological parameters derived\nusing INSAT-3DR are same as that of INSAT-3D, with 15 minute time gap. In both the satellites,\nspectrum of the atmosphere is covered by six imager channels i.e. the Visible (VIS), Short-wave\ninfrared (SWIR), Mid-wave infrared (MIR), Water vapor (WV) and two split window thermal\ninfrared (TIR1 and TIR2) channels. The image registration accuracy significantly improved\nbecause of star sensors are present on both the satellites. The individual INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR\nAMVs are derived every 30-minute intervals. As an example, the INSAT-3D AMVs are retrieved\nat 0000, 0030, 0100 UTC, while INSAT-3DR AMVs are derived at 0015, 0045, 0115 UTC\nrespectively. The AMV derived from these satellites are widely accepted by different national and\ninternational operational agencies. In the present study, the algorithm for deriving AMVs using\ninfrared and water vapor images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR data in staggering mode is\ndemonstrated. Subsequently, this new AMVs generated using staggering mode will bee inter-\ncompared with individually retrieved INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR AMVs.\n14.2.2. Objective\nThe availability of data from both INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR with similar spectral characteristic\nand region of interest, at every 15-minutes has motivated to re-look further for the improvement\nin retrieval algorithm to get better quality AMVs over the Indian Ocean region. The specific reason\nfor this motivation is that in stead of using 30-minute images for winds retrieval, the accuracy of\nwinds will improve if shorter spatio-temporal images are used during the retrieval. The main\nobjective of this study is to derive the algorithm for retrieving AMVs using infrared and water\nvapor images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR data in staggering mode.\n14.3. Inputs\n14.3.1.

Algorithm Functional Specifications\n14.4.1. Methodology\nThe operationally four different spectral channels of INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR are used to derive\nAMVs over the Indian Ocean region and operational retrieval algorithm is described in Deb et al.\n2016. In the present document, a new staggering algorithm is discussed where data from infrared\n(i.e. TIR1) and water vapor (i.e. WV) channels of both the satellites are used simultaneously for\nhigher temporal scale retrieval. Although the major steps of retrieval algorithm (i.e. Tracer\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 152\nselection, height assignment, tracking and quality control etc) staggering algorithm is same as\npresent operational algorithm, however a few changes incorporated in the new algorithm to\nminimize the inaccuracies due to two separate satellite platform is shown in the following Figure\n-1.\nFigure 1: The flowcharts of staggering AMVs retrieval algorithm using INSAT-3D/3DR data\nAt first, the satellite ID from which first input image is coming is checked, if it is from INSAT-\n3DR, then second image from INSAT-3D is read. In the first image possible cloud tracers are\nidentified and each selected tracer is represented by a box of 32 x 32 pixel. The tracer box in the\nfirst image (i.e. INSAT-3DR) is calibrated with respect to the collocated box in second image (i.e.\nINSAT-3D) using the following formula:\nÔÄ® ÔÄ©var(I )\nI ÔÄΩ I ÔÄ≠I 2 ÔÄ´I\n1 1 1 var(I ) 2\n1 .\nHere, I and I represent the 32 x 32 (in pixel) tracer boxes from first and second image\n1 2\nrespectively. Var(I ) and Var(I ) represent the variance of the tracer boxes. This is performed to\n1 2\nreduce the uncertainty in inter-calibration of two different satellites, all-though their sensor\nspecifications are exactly same. Then cloud tracers are selected by local image anomaly technique\nin a particular image and subsequently height of the selected tracers is calculated. The height\nassignment component of operational AMV retrieval algorithm uses widely used traditional\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 153\nmethods viz. the infrared window (WIN) technique, the H O intercept method (Nieman et al.,\n2\n1993) and the cloud base method (LeMarshall et. al., 1993). Then selected tracers are tracked in\nlarger window in the subsequent image by using the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency [Nash and\nSutcliffe, 1970] coefficient. The detailed description of each step is already discussed in the\nAlgorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) of infrared and water vapor winds from INSAT-\n3D or INSAT-3DR (Deb et al. 2008)\nFigure 2: A sample flow-diagram of methodology for the retrieval of AMVs in staggering mode for a\nparticular time 0500 UTC.\nIf the selected first image is from INSAT-3D, the tracers are selected and height assignment is done,\nthen before tracking the selected tracers in the second INSAT-3DR image, collocated tracer box in\nINSAT-3DR is calibrated to INSAT-3D equivalent. The process of tracer selection, height\nassignment and tracking is repeated for sixteen pair of images to generate sixteen pairs of raw\nwinds which is called as wind buffer. Later, this wind buffer is used for quality control of AMVs.\nDuring the quality control, temporal, spatial consistency checks are performed with neighboring\nvectors extracted from the wind buffer. A sample flow-diagram of methodology for the retrieval\nof staggering AMVs at 0500 UTC is shown in Figure-2. To derive winds valid at 0500 UTC\nrequires total seventeen images of 15-minute interval viz. nine images from INSAT-3D starting\nfrom 0100 UTC and eight images from INSAT-3DR starting from 0115 UTC. In the next steps\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 154\nwind buffer is calculated using sixteen wind pairs. In the following step quality control technique\nis applied to wind buffer to estimate the final output valid at 0500 UTC.\n14.4.2. Operational Implementation\nStep 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT\nÔÇ∑ Since accuracy of the wind is dependent on image registration and it is assumed here that\nall input images are well registered. The details algorithm for registration is defined in the\ndata product document as provided by DP team. In this step a radiation model will be\nused to convert the instrument measured radiance into brightness temperature. This\nrequires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the satellite.\nStep 2: Tracer selection from image\nÔÇ∑ Read first two registered images from INSAT-3D and INSAT-3DR.\nÔÇ∑ Choose the tracer box in the first image (i.e. 3D) and calibrate the similar tracer box from\n3DR from second image into 3D equivalent.\nÔÇ∑ Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the maximum local gradients\nsurrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness\ntemperature of the window.\nStep 3: Height assignment\nÔÇ∑ For height assignment use brightness temperature from single satellite (i.e either 3D or\n3DR) to avoid height inaccuracies due to inter-calibration of two satellites.\nÔÇ∑ Assign height of the tracer using IR window technique. In this case the brightness\ntemperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with collocated numerical\nmodel temperature profile. The level of optimum fit will be assigned as initial height.\nÔÇ∑ Re-assign the height using H O intercept technique for semi-transparent tracers.\n2\nÔÇ∑ Re-assign the height using cloud-base height assignment technique.\nÔÇ∑ Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique mentioned\nabove.\nÔÇ∑ Height optimization using minimized differences with first guess.\nStep 4: Tracking\nÔÇ∑ Before tracking the tracer selected from first image in the second image, bigger tracking\narea in the second image is calibrated with respect to the first image.\nÔÇ∑\nThe tracking employs a simple search for the mean absolute difference of the radiance\ndifference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half hourly images. This\nsearch will be done in the direction of 30o of model wind.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 155\nStep 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control\nÔÇ∑ The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images (viz. the\nwinds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file.

Data required\nParameter Type Source\nWind Collocated Radiosonde Profiles IMD\n14.6.2. Methods of validation\nThe evaluation of CMV should be taken into both qualitative and quantitative measures.\nQuantitative assessment of the CMV product is possible from statistical analyses and impact on\nNWP. The traditional method of validation is matching observations with collocated radiosondes.\nThe statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS winds evaluation reporting\nguidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of product quality over time and can be\nemployed in determining observation weight in objective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII\nthe Working Group on Satellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind\nproduction quality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The\nrecommended three parts to the report.\na. Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and satellite\nwinds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) levels together with\nthe radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for three latitude bands: north of 20\nN, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S.\nb. Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water vapor\nmotion vectors through the last 12 months.\nc. Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm.\nThe vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated radiosonde\nreport used for verification is given by\n(VD) = [ (Ui ‚Äì Ur)2 + (Vi ‚Äì Vr)2 ]1/2\nThe speed bias is given by\nN\n(BIAS)i = 1/N ‚àë [( Ui2 + V i2 )1/2 - (Ur2 + Vr2 )1/2 ]\ni=1\nThe mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is\nN\n(MVD) = 1/N ‚àë (VD)i\ni=1\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 157\nAnd the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally reported is\nN\n(SD) = [1/N ‚àë ( (VDi) ‚Äì (MVD) )2 ]1/2\ni=1\nThe root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum of the\nsquares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean vector difference,\n(RMSE) = [(MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2\nN\n(‚àÜU2) = ‚àë (Ui ‚ÄìUr)2\ni=1\nN\n(‚àÜV2) = ‚àë (Vi ‚ÄìVr)2\ni=1\n(MCD) = [ (‚àÜU2) + (‚àÜV2) ]1/2 ‚â† (MVD)\nIt must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the mean\ncomponent difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the\ndeviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector.\nTo avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean vector\ndifference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to CGMS\nguideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should be 7m/s\nrespectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of winds should\nbe about zero.\n14.7. Technical Issues (Limitations etc)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the\nregistration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However the\nfollowing limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially coherent, high\nresolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible from geostationary satellite remote\nsensing of water vapor. CMV are comparable in quality to operational upper-level cloud-motion\nvectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining moisture structure,\nthough they have the ability to obtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and\nregions of strong subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports;\nhowever, upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations.\na. Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed retrieval\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 158\nThis sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different vertical levels as\nwell as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity of atmospheric jets, the\nretrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in the assigned pressure levels. Based\non some standard analysis ( e.g. NCEP reanalysis of 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a\nquantitative assessment of the vertical and spatial structure of this sensitivity.\nb. Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment\nWe plan to use IMD‚Äôs operational regional model output during height assignment procedure.\nHowever, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of AMV retrieval, either\nIMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational model, or a lower-quality solution\nbased on the output of coarser-resolution GCM will be generated over the regions not covered by\nIMD‚Äôs regional model.\nc. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment\nTo use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to find the\noptimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may increase the AMV turn-\naround time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway to develop an empirical version of\nRT model that can be used for simulation of IR and water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of\ncloud heights. The inverse of this empirical model will then be used in real-time applications.\nd. Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods for tracking of\ncloud-tracers.\nThe comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was found that the\nefficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum cross correlation (MCC)\nmethods are comparable, while the MDM method is significantly faster than MCC.\nReferences\nDeb, S.K., C.M.

INTRODUCTION\nWeather and climate affects many sectors of the human activity as well as many aspects of the\nworld's natural ecosystems. The hydrological cycle is one of the important components of Weather\nand climate system. The hydrological cycle describes the exchange of water substance between\nsea, air, soil, rock, plants and animals. The precipitation and evaporation processes significantly\naffect the global hydrological cycle. The quantitative assessment of precipitation is needed to\nimprove understanding of the behavior of global energy and circulation patterns as well as the\nnature of climate variability. The choice of measured parameter has been influenced by the cost of\ninstallation, operation, longevity and temporal as well as spatial coverage of the instruments. The\nland based techniques of rainfall estimation are not sufficient for global rainfall assessment as\nabout 70% of the Earth is covered with water. The space borne measurement and monitoring of\nrainfall is, therefore, a topic of major interest since they provide global coverage both on land and\nocean for an extended period of time. A longstanding promise of meteorological satellites is the\nimproved identification and quantification of precipitation at time scales consistent with the nature\nand development of precipitation processes. Meteorological satellites expand the coverage and\ntime span of conventional ground-based rainfall data for a number of applications. The primary\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 162\nscope of satellite rainfall monitoring is to provide information on rainfall occurrence, amount and\ndistribution over the regional to continental scales. The uneven distribution of rain gauges and\nweather radars and the relative lack of rainfall measurements over the oceans have significantly\nlimited the use of global as well local data. Precipitation is one of the most variable quantities in\nspace and time. Precipitation also has a direct impact on human life that other atmospheric\nphenomena seldom have: an example is represented by heavy rain events and flash floods (Barrett\nand Michell, 1991). Geostationary weather satellite visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) imagers provide\nthe rapid temporal update cycle needed to capture the growth and decay of precipitating clouds.\nMicrowaves provide the interaction of radiation with hydrometeors but with coarser resolution and\nlimited swath widths of satellites with in tropical orbit such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring\nMission (TRMM) (Kummerow et al., 1998) and of sensors in polar orbits like the Special Sensor\nMicrowave Imager (SSM/I) series.\n15.2.1 Overview\nOperational applications, require quantitative rainfall determination from a variety of precipitating\nsystems, which differ both dynamically and microphysically. This fact prompts for non-unique\nsolutions based on the physics of precipitation formation processes. Barrett and Martin (1981) and\nKidder and Vonder Haar (1995) give excellent reviews of the available methods. Petty (1995) has\nexamined the status of satellite rainfall estimation over land. Recent reviews Levizzani et al. (2001)\nhas covered results and future perspectives from the geostationary orbit. The perspective varies\nwidely from the relatively simple methods used for climatic-scale analyses (e.g. Arkin and\nArdanuy, 1989; Arkin and Janowiak, 1991) to the more elaborate instantaneous rainrate\nestimations for research and nowcasting (Ba and Gruber, 2001; Turk et al., 2000; Vicente et al.,\n1998).\nRecent technological developments of MW instruments on board polar orbiters have been dramatic\nbut the use of VIS, IR and water vapor (WV) channels of geostationary satellites is still\nindispensable. In particular, the launch of the newest generation of geostationary satellites, the\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES-I-M series (Menzel and Purdom,1994)\nand the upcoming METEOSAT Second Generation (MSG) (Schmetz et al., 2002) with its Spinning\nEnhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI), adds new channels to the traditional VIS/IR/WV\ntriplet. Some of the new channels have been tested for decades as part of the Advanced Very High\nResolution Radiometer (AVHRR) series on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) polar orbiters or have other heritages.\nMultispectral data have long since been available both from polar orbiting and geostationary\nsatellite sensors and used for retrieving cloud properties. The relevant channels for cloud\ncharacterization were part of the payload of the polar satellites, while the sensors at\ngeosynchronous altitude were almost exclusively devoted to VIS-IR operational monitoring of\nprecipitation system displacements. This has considerably changed in the past few years since\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 163\nmore and more sophisticated sensors have been conceived for the GEO orbits that will allow for\nglobal real-time cloud characterization.\nCloud radiative properties at VIS, near IR (NIR) and IR wavelengths have long since been studied\nand documented (among others Arking and Childs, 1985; Cheng et al., 1993, Saunders and Kriebel,\n1988; Slingo and Schrecker, 1982). In the thermal IR the radiative properties are sensitive to the\nsize distribution of the hydrometeors. In particular, an increase in the particle size increases the\ntransmissivity, decreasing the reflectivity and increasing the emissivity of the cloud layer. This\nlatter dominates at these wavelengths. In the NIR (e.g. the 3.9 mm MSG channel) the emissivity\nof a cloud layer is lower than in the thermal IR window: there is a large contribution of reflected\nradiation at the cloud top. Clouds with small hydrometeors scatter and reflect much of the 3.9 mm\nradiance. An increase in cloud particle size or the presence of large drops or ice crystals near the\ncloud top reduces the 3.9 mm reflectance from the cloud. containing more ice reflect less solar\nradiation in the 3.7 - 3.9 mm range as ice strongly absorbs at these wavelengths and ice crystals\nare generally larger than cloud droplets at cloud top. NIR reflectance mostly refers to cloud\nparticles effective radius (re).VIS reflectance is primarily due to cloud optical depth.\nSeveral methods have been proposed for the retrieval of cloud parameters from various cloud\ntypes. Pioneering studies were conducted by Arking and Childs (1985) and Nakajima and King\n(1990). Water Vapor images show the presence of water in the gas form between 22,000 and 35,000\nfeet above the earth's surface. The brighter white color indicates areas of moisture. Black depicts\nneutral. Lensky and Rosenfeld (1997) have conceived a multispectral rainfall estimation technique\nbased on the method of Rosenfeld and Gutman (1994). They concentrated on areas of around 2000\nkm2 that Rosenfeld and Gagin (1989) showed to be the critical limit beyond which a further\nincrease in cloud cluster area does not result in higher rain rates.\nIR and NIR channels other than the thermal IR window show some potential for application to\nrainfall estimations. Techniques for the instantaneous delineation of convective rainfall areas using\nsplit window data were initially conceived for the NOAA AVHRR (Inoue, 1987a,b, 1997) and are\ninstrumental for the detection of semi-transparent cirrus clouds (Inoue, 1985). These techniques\nrely upon the detection of non-precipitating cirrus and low-level cumulus clouds using the two\nwindow channels at 10.5 - 11.5 and 11.5 - 12.5 ¬µm (the so-called split window). The information\ncontent of the split window channels partially corrects erroneous rainfall area delineation (and\nconsequent frequent rainfall overestimate) of simple IR techniques producing better false alarm\nratios (FAR). The NIR 3.9 ¬µm channel of GOES-8/9 satellites includes spectral features suitable\nfor applications to rainfall detection and estimation. This channel was included for a long time in\nNOAA/AVHRR instruments (centered at 3.7 ¬µm) for a variety of purposes including ice\ndiscrimination and sun-glint detection. Vicente (1996) developed a simple and fast algorithm for\nrainfall retrieval using the 11 and 3.9 ¬µm channels with the obvious advantage of nighttime use\nand sensitivity to the presence of ice and water vapor.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 164\nIn the present ATBD document the description of the scientific algorithms which will be developed\nand used to estimate rainfall from two of the standard operational algorithms of NOAA from the\ndata acquired by the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR ) onboard INSAT-3D satellite.\nVHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), Near Infra-red (NIR), Mid\nWave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the spectrum covering the following\nchannels: VIS 0.6Œºm, NIR 1.6Œºm, MWIR 3.9Œºm, WV 6.7Œºm, IR 10.8Œºm, IR 12.0Œºm . Each\nchannel of the Imager has different resolution as mentioned in the Table-1 in sections ahead.\n15.2.2. Objectives\nThere are two main objectives under the rainfall retrieval algorithms from INSAT-3D.. These\ntechniques are now known as GOES Precipitation Index (GPI) and INSAT Multispectral Rainfall\nAlgorithm Technique (IMSRA). Both the algorithms are state of art and aimed at estimation of\nrainfall with different applications at different spatial and temporal requirements respectively. First\nGPI related objectives are the implementation of the algorithm following Arkin (1979), while the\nsecond one is related to the development of the algorithm named GMSRA following Ba and Gruber\n(2001). Originally the GPI technique has been in operation for a large scale rainfall estimation by\nNational community for more than two decades. The IMSRA on the other hand is a new one and\nis developed\nThe inherent limitations of optical channels remains persistent for rainfall retrieval as the rainfall\nin the ground is inferred by cloud top signatures only. There is no direct physical connection\nbetween the rain/cloud and ice hydrometeors within the clouds with radiance emanating from\ncloud tops to the sensor. The accuracy of rainfall estimate is improves only marginally even with\nsignificant new efforts. However, the high spatial and temporal coverage of Geostationary optical\nmeasurements is the very strong point along with the resolution capabilities of the sensors. At the\nsame time microwaves have a direct physical connections with vertical structure of rainfall and\nthus with the cloud, rain and ice hydrometeors. But the non-portability of microwave sensors to\nthe geostationary platforms till date due to technological constraints is a limitation and thus only\nlow earth orbiting satellites can provide the rainfall information of land, ocean and atmosphere as\non now. With the advent of active and passive radar and radiometric sensors onboard a single\nsatellite (e.g. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission-TRMM) we envisaged that a technique like\nGMSRA can be further improved for Indian tropical regions and more reliable rainfall information\ncan be retrieved. We henceforth call this technique as INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm\n(IMSRA), as a specific technique for Indian Tropical regions. Our objectives for both the\ntechniques (GPI and IMSRA) here are based on these premises and are outlined below (mainly in\ncases of IMSRA).\nA1. INSAT-3D Rainfall using GPI Method:\n1. To generate a total day rainfall maps using 3 hourly brightness temperatures of IR (11 um)\nimages for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -500 to +500 lat and 300E to 1300E\nusing Arkin‚Äôs GPI method.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 165\n2. To generate mean spatial variance and histogram of 24 classes of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg\nlatitude/longitude.\n3. To derive QPE based on daily basis following the 3 hourly data of IR observations (8 images\na day).\n4. Validation of rainfall products using rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data.\n5 . Inter-satellite comparison using other contemporary satellites like Meteosat, NOAA etc.\n6. Estimation of rainfall on pentad, monthly mean, seasonal mean and annual mean scales after\ndue calibration/validation from radar and inter-satellite comparisons as above, rainfall.\nA2. To Develop Precipitation Estimates Using the Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA)\nTechnique:\nThe relation between precipitation amount and cloud fraction as seen from satellite passive\nradiometers in case of GPI technique above, though simple and straightforward it might seem, has\nnot yet reached completely satisfactory accuracy, effectiveness, and time/space coverage. There\nare numerous applications in meteorology and hydrology where accurate information at scales\nsmaller than the existing 1.0ÔÇ∞ products (e.g. daily or sub daily estimates at resolutions of 1ÔÇ∞ and\ndown to the 0.10 0 and pixel scales) would be invaluable. There is also increasing demand from\nthe meteorology and climate community for such products over extended periods. High-resolution\nrainfall information is available for limited areas using combinations of ground-based radar and\ndense networks of rain gauges. In India in particular, where the need of high spatial and temporal\nrainfall is essential, for large and varied areas of India (Western Ghats, plateaus, Himalayan\nRegions, North-Eastern Regions, Arid and Semi-Arid Zones) however, the in-situ infrastructure\nnecessary for this form of precipitation monitoring network is not in place. Recent developments\nmostly refer to microwave (MW) sensors on board polar orbiters, but the use of visible (VIS) and\ninfrared (IR) sensors of geostationary satellites for a variety of applications is by no means over.\nThus a suit of both supplementing each others would be the ideal situation, particularly when the\nhighly advanced microwave sensors data from various international satellites are available on near\nreal time basis.\nThe main objectives here in IMSRA algorithm are to estimate rainfall by developing a\nMultispectral Rainfall Algorithm which is an optimal combination of GMSRA and some of the\ninnovative proposed approaches that utilizes microwave remote sensing measurements from polar\norbiting satellites. Here, the rainfall algorithm is with more advantageous that combines satellite\npassive microwave and infrared (IR) data to account for limitations in both data types. Rainfall\nestimates are produced at the high spatial resolution and temporal frequency of the IR data using\nrainfall information from the PMW data. Over the last few years, a number of groups world wide\nhave embarked on development of such techniques wherein the advantages of geosynchronous\nviz. vast coverage and near sufficient space-time sampling, and polar passive microwave\nradiometers viz. more physically based retrievals, are synergistically used to\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 166\ngenerate tropical rainfall on various scales (e.g. Adler et al. 1994, Todd et al. 2001, Gairola\nand Krishnamurti 1992). With above background the objectives for Multi Spectral Rainfall\nAlgorithm (IMSRA) are as follows.\nThe technique has the following components:\n1. Identify areas for very deep convective cores from IR and WV channels ( 11ÔÅ≠m-6.7ÔÅ≠m),\nwhich corresponds well with rainfall.\n2. To screen mid-to upper level clouds with or without thin cirrus above the rain and non-rain\nbaring clouds.\n3. Cloud growth classification based on temporal gradients of TIR ‚Äì TB‚Äôs.\n4. Filtering of low and non raining clouds along with the warm and semi-transperent clouds\nbased on IR and WV when rainfall is estimated for clouds having brightness temperatures\ncolder than 240K.\n5. Spatial and temporal co-location of INSAT-TIR brightness temperature, and TRMM /\nSSM/I rainfall for creation of matched database.\n6.

The rainfall from those DWRs, which will be well\ncalibrated using an appropriate site specific Z-R relationship over Indian regional sites of the\nrespective radar locations will be used for validation. In some cases one hourly rainfall from fast\nresponse rain gauges would be highly desirable particularly the areas where the DWR coverage is\nnot at all there.

Overview:\nNOAA/NESDIS emphasizes use of meteorological satellites for the study of flash floods. Heavy\nprecipitation and flash floods are often a multi scale and concatenating event from the global scale\nto the synoptic scale, to the mesoscale and finally to the storm scale. Satellite-derived algorithms,\nconceptual models, and interpretation techniques are used to provide information on these various\nscales to monitor, assess, and predict heavy precipitation and flash floods. In the satellite data,\nglobal scale connections between the tropics and middle latitudes are observed. These\nconnections are movements, surges, or plumes of water vapor that are often associated with\nunstable air and prepare the environment for heavy precipitation and flash floods. On the synoptic\nscale, the 6.7 ÔÅ≠m water vapor is especially useful for detecting jet streaks, vorticity centers and\nother features that are associated with upward vertical motion and lift the moist, unstable air\nresulting in the production of clouds and precipitation. Whether or not heavy precipitation and\nflash floods will occur are generally determined on the mesoscale to storm scale. On the\nmesoscale, infrared (10.7 ÔÅ≠m and 3.9 ÔÅ≠m), visible, and water vapor (6.7 ÔÅ≠m) are used to locate\nboundaries (both frontal and thunderstorm-produced) and short waves that may initiate, focus, and\nmaintain the heavy precipitation. Terrain features such as orographic uplift have the same effect\nof anchoring, intensifying, and prolonging the precipitation. On the storm scale, the intensity,\nmovement, and propagation of the precipitation system (e.g., thunderstorms) is used to determine\nhow much, when, and where the heavy precipitation is going to move during the next zero to three\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 169\nhours (called Nowcasting). High resolution infrared (10.7 ÔÅ≠m) and visible are the principal data\nsets used in this diagnosis.\nLarge scale precipitation values are of importance in many fields and anomalies in large scale\nprecipitation are also known to have a close relationship with global circulation anomalies.\nSatellite based rain estimation techniques can be classified into two broad categories, viz, (1)\nestimation of precipitation on near real time, e.g. Scofield and Oliver (1977), etc. and (2) estimation\nof average precipitation over a large area for a period of time ranging from a day to a month e.g.,\nRichards and Arkin (1981) etc. In any of these two the estimation criteria is based on some\nstatistical relationship.\nIn case of GOES, data from five channels are used: the visible channel (0.65 mm), used when\navailable to select optically thick clouds; channel 2 (3.9 mm), used to retrieve reff of hydrometeors\nduring daytime; the water vapor channel (6.7 mm); and thermal channels 4 (11 mm) and 5 (12 mm).\nThe 11 mm channel is used to determine cloud-top brightness temperature, and the 12-mm channel\nis used in conjunction with the 11-mm channel to estimate cloud-top temperature. The estimated\ncloudtop temperature is utilized to compute the thermal emission at 3.9 mm, which is then\nsubtracted from measurements of that channel to yield the reflected solar radiation in the 3.9-mm\nspectral band.\nIn the statistical relationship between IR cloud pixel brightness temperature from satellite sensor\nand surface rainfall measurements the mean rainfall rate R varies as a function of brightness\ntemperature (BT). But the uncertainty in rainfall rate is quite large and also varies with BT. The\nGPI method uses a simple two-piece threshold function approximation of this relationship\nAlthough crude, the GPI method works quite well for the estimation of monthly rainfall over large\nareas, partly because the over- and underestimation of spatial and temporal errors cancel each other\nin the aggregation procedure.\nComplete software package for derivation of QPE using Kalpana-1, INSAT-3D,3DR VHRR data\nfrom two important algorithms like GPI, and IMSRA has been attempted. Both of them are the\noperational at NOAA/NESDIS and has been developed after years of research and development\nefforts by various investigators. The theoretical background for GPI and GMSRA respectively are\ngiven below:\n15.4.1.1. Theoretical Background for GPI Algorithm:\n15.4.1.1.1 Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images\nThe satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the atmosphere or\nfrom the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated over all wavelength,\nby Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of temperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann\nlaw is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium emits spectral radiant energy according to\nsome temperature less than its thermal temperature, than a second factor called emissivity is\nintroduced. The emissivity of a body determine its emission efficiency. Thus, we can define\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 170\nbrightness temperature of a body T , which is related to its physical temperature T by following\nb\nequation:\nT = ÔÅ• T\nb\nwhere, ÔÅ• is emissivity of the object. If. ÔÅ• = 1, T = T, its a black body; if ÔÅ• = 0, T = 0, its a white\nb b\nbody; if 0 < ÔÅ• < 1, Tb < T, and its a gray body.\nThe IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 ÔÅ≠m. This is a\natmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In this\nband the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous constituents\nof the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation, measured\nintensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those surfaces, which\nare not opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated by effective emissivity\ntimes fourth power of the temperature. This effective emissivity will be referred more often as\ncloud emissivity here after. The cloud emissivity cannot be measured from observations at a\nsingle wavelength interval. Often it is simply assumed to be unity. Then the temperature calculated\nfrom observed intensity of radiation is called `brightness temperature‚Äô. Only when ÔÅ• = 1, brightness\ntemperature equals to black body temperature.\nThe value of IR measurements to rainfall estimate lies in the nearly universal condition of lapse of\ntemperature with height through the troposphere. If the temperature is known with height, either\nfrom actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be infrared from the satellite\nIR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this context, because ÔÅ• < 1 implies clouds\nwhich are thin (and therefore without precipitation). The more serious problem is distinguishing\nbetween cold clouds that are radiometerelly thick but are confined to the upper and middle\ntroposphere, and cold clouds which extend into lower troposphere.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 171\n15.4.1.1.2 Flow Chart for QPE from GPI:\nINSAT IR Data\n3 Hourly Image\nLook Up Table for\nConversion from Grey\nCalibration\nCount to TBs\nGeneration of 24\nDetection of Deep\nClasses Histogram,\nConvective Clouds\nmean & variance\nFractional\nRain Cloud\nEstimation of Rainfall\nEstimation of daily\nRainfall (8 images)\nEstimation of Daily, Weekly,\nMonthly Rainfall\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 172\n15.4.1.1.3. Operational Implementation\nStep 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT\nThe INSAT-3D infrared thermal images of 0000, 03000, 0600, ‚Ä¶., 2100 UTC, i.e., every\nthree hours, are to be used. Infrared pixel has dimensions of 4x4 km in case of INSAT-3D,\n3DR, so that several pixels fall within 1.00x1.00 box. The grey shade value (0-1023) of\neach pixel in a given image is read and the corresponding brightness temperature is to be\ncalculated from a look-up table. Pixel lying outside the chosen area of analysis are to be\nignored while within it are assigned to appropriate box.\nStep 2: Histogram Generation:\nAfter the temperatures of all the pixels in a box are known they are to be distributed to\ngenerate 3 hourly 24 class histogram of brightness temperatures of IR (11 um) images for\n1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -50 to + 50 deg. lat and 30 to 130 deg\nlongitude from the sub-satellite point.\nStep 3: Grid-wise Statistics\nGenerate 3 hourly mean and spatial variance of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg\nlatitude/longitude within the area 40 deg lat/long from the sub-satellite point.\nStep 4: Grid-wise Rain Clod Detection:\nThe fractional cloud coverage within a grid box is the ratio of the pixels of cooler than\nspecified threshold temperature to the total number of pixels. This gives the measure of the\nfractional area of the box covered by clouds with tops colder than threshold. Finally the\nestimates of precipitation using the GPI technique in the grid spacing of 1.0ÔÇ∞ x 1.0ÔÇ∞ lat/lon\nwill be carried out. This work indicated a high correlation between the fractional coverage\nof \"cold\" clouds and observed rainfall. It was determined that the highest correlation\nbetween the parameters was produced using a 1.0 degree latitude/longitude spatial scale.\nAn estimation method using linear regression was developed. The regression procedure\nyielded the simple estimation equation:\nR = [3 mm h-1] X [frac] X [hours]\nwhere R is the rainfall estimate in millimeters; frac is the fractional coverage of cloud-top\ntemperature < 235K for the desired 1.0 degree latitude/longitude region; and hours\nindicate the number of hours in the observation period.\nStep: 5 Validations:\nRegarding the validation of the derived QPE the DWR and Surface Rain Gauges (SFRG)\nData at different spatial and temporal scales will be highly desirable in and around the\nmaximum validation sites in temporal window of every hour.\nRemarks:\nDuring the days when all the 8 images per day are not available, rain rate will be provided with a\nflag. Provisions of average rainfall estimation will be made for all the cases when more than 50%\nof data is available. Similar approach will be followed with the Pentad or Monthly scale average\nrainfall estimates.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 173\n15.4.1.2. IMSRA Technique:\n15.4.1.2.1. Theoretical Background:\nThe developmental work related to the INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA)\nproposed here as an inhouse R & D effort, originally follows the GMSRA approach along with\ninnovative alternative features (i.e. the satellite microwave radiometric measurements) for the\nestimation of precipitation. The theoretical basis is that\n1. Bright clouds in the VIS and clouds with cold tops in the IR imagery that are expanding (in\nearly and mature stages of development) produce more rainfall.\n2. Clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce little or no rainfall.\n3. Merging of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds increases the rainfall rate of the merging clouds.\n4. Most of the significant rainfall occurs in the upwind (at anvil level) portion of a convective\nsystem.\n5. Cloud micro-physics plays an important role in understanding the precipitation and thus\neffective radius of cloud top temperatures are to be known (say 3.9 mm during day time).\n6. For each pixel classified as containing raining clouds based on above criterions, the\nassociated instantaneous rain rate will be computed using pre-calibrated mean rain rate and\ncloud top brightness temperature relationship based on the equation developed using al\nlarge data base of IR-TBs and TRMM-Precipitation Radar data (Gairola et al. 2010b) The\nretrieved rainfall from earlier step and Doppler Weather Radar data on available locations\nin India would be used for offline validation of the algorithm. This will be based on the\nlarge collocated data base of DWR and IMSRA rainfall within 0.1x0.1 deg resolution.\n7. Production of rainfall maps on every half hourly and daily basis on pixel scale with option\nfor higher grid spacing.\nSeveral such features are integrated in finalizing the estimation of rainfall using measurements\nfrom mult-spectral channels (Vis, IR, WV and microwave etc.). Physical explanation of rainfall\nwith infrared (IR) images have been discussed previously which is common for GPI algorithm. In\naddition the Physical explanation of rainfall with visible (vis) images is being presented here in\nbrief. Various researches so far have pointed that that with thicker clouds the probability of rainfall\nand rain intensity is increased. This relationship is strongest for clouds warmer than -15¬∞ C. It is\nalso noted that marine clouds produce heavier rainfall. The possible explanation for this lies in the\nprocess of cloud growth and droplet growth rates. In clouds warmer than -15¬∞ C, precipitation\nresults from coalescence. The large cloud thickness allows more time for growth before droplets\nfall out of the cloud. However, the other factors like droplet concentration, evaporation and cloud\ntemperature are also important. Differences in precipitation probability between marine and\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 174\ncontinental clouds were attributed to difference in concentration of condensation nuclei and of\ndroplets, and difference in evaporation below the cloud base.\nSatellite passive microwave and more recently, active microwave rain radar are able to provide\naccurate estimation of rain rates. However they are known to have but poor temporal sampling.\nAgain the estimates from polar orbiting satellites are subject to the bias in regions where diurnal\ncycle of rainfall is pronounced. Still the instantaneous measurements of rainfall from microwave\nsensors are more accurate and thus are useful in calibrating other sensors like visible and IR. At\npresent, the algorithms for the quantitative estimation of rainfall from microwave observations are\nquite successful but suffer from a scarcity of sufficient verification data over the oceans.\nTheoretical and empirical studies addressing the problem of rain retrieval and their critical\nassessment continues to appear. A definitive algorithm is contnuously in developing stage because\nof the complex and variable microphysical and mesoscale structure of precipitation vis-√†-vis\ncoarser resolution of microwave sensors. As a source of microwave measurements, we use the\nrainfall data from the SSM/I Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Several\nalgorithms have been developed for various SSM/I sensors of the DMSP series. The SSM/I rainfall\nused here is based on Ferraro and Marks (1995). The SSM/I had a conical scan with a swath width\nof about 1400 km and TRMM has swath width of about 800 km and the rainfall is retrieved by\nNASA-GPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm. Use of microwave data with those of VI/IR is most\nplausible choice to mitigate the problem of resolution in microwaves and augmentation of rain\nestimates from IR measurements.\nFollowing the main features of Ba and Gruber (2001), from GMSRA, IMSRA is thus proposed\nin combination with additional satellite microwave measurements. Thus the principal innovations\nof IMSRA relative to previous infrared/visible algorithms alone is that it combines several cloud\nproperties used in a variety of techniques in a single and comprehensive rainfall algorithm.\nHowever our recent sensitivity study has suggested that the environmental correction factor\n(PWRH) is more suitable for larger scale rainfall (such as in GPI within 10 x10) than for (IMSRA\nwithin or less than 0.10x0.10). This factor now has not been invoked on IMSRA algorithm any\nmore.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 175\n15.4.1.2.2 IMSRA Algorithm\nFig. 2 Flow Chart for IMSRA Algorithm\nINSAT TIR, WV Data\nHalf Hourly Image\nConversion from Grey Look Up Table for\nCount to TBs Calibration\nSatellite Microwave\nThermal IR Brightness Grid Average of\nRainfall (TRMM/PR)\nTemp. 11 and 6.7 micron\nIR TBs\nCollocation of IR Grid Avg. Rainfall\nTBs and Microwave (TRMM/ PR)\nRainfall\nEstimation of Rainfall\nfrom IR\n15.4.1.3 Modified INSAT-3D Rainfall IMSRA scheme:\nSo far the IMSRA, that has been working as an operational algorithm at IMD combines mul-\ntispectral optical measurements of the satellites to estimate rainfall along with the additional\nsatellite microwave measurements. Thus the principal innovations of IMSRA relative to previous\ninfrared/visible algorithms alone is that it combines several cloud properties used in a variety of\ntechniques in a single and comprehensive rainfall algorithm. For example, the technique uses\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 176\ncloud-top temperatures as a basis of rain estimation (e.g., Arkin and Meisner 1987; Ba et al. 1995;\nVicente et al. 1998), and it utilizes the effective radii of cloud particles (e.g., Rosenfeld and Gutman\n1994) and spatial and temporal temperature gradients (e.g., Adler and Negri 1988; Vicente et al.\n1998) to screen out nonraining clouds. The algorithm have the number of steps which are already\nencorporated and described in Gairola et al. (2007).\nBased on a number of case studies and research works carried out during last few years, some\nmore innovative elements are recognized for further refinements of the algorithm. In this regard,\na three ‚Äìtier correction scheme is designed for IMSRA algorithm based on the intercomparison\nwith TRMM-3B42 rainfall estimates. The Procedure adopts an overall correction of rain followed\nby corrections for orography and cloud growth/decay correction based on the study of Woodley ,\nSancho and Vicente (1972). Finally to further refine the IMSRA rainfall estimates the synergistic\nuse of INSAT-3D derived IMSRA rainfall and rain gauge data from IMD is proposed based on the\nobjective criteria.\nHere the the original IMSRA algorithm has been retained as it is, except the environmental\ncorrection factor module has been dropped as it is adding more errors due to different decorelation\nlengths of rainfall and relative humidity & precipitable water. The flowchart of the modified\nalgorithm is given in Figure 3 where recent developments have been added to the original scheme\nin above flowchart Figure 2, tested and implemented in many case studies by Mahesh et al. (2015).\nThe global bias correction based on a priory data base is followed from a polynomial model of the\nform y=‚àë a xi and the orographic correction is based on the climatology and using an\ni , i=0...2\nelliptical weighting function (Mahesh et al., 2014). The global bias correction is designed on the\nbasis of comparison with TRMM-3B42 daily average rain (June and July). The average bias\nbetween the rain estimates of TRMM-3B42 and IMSRA rain is absorbed into a polynomial model.\nOrographic correction is computed on the basis of a climatological ratio bias between IMSRA and\nTRMM-3B42 for the orographic regions. It is applied as a symmetrically reducing elliptical\nweighting function of the form\nW= (A2 - S2) / (A2 + S2 ‚Äì 2LF2)\nA= d1 + d2 where d1 and d2 are the distances from the end points of a line with two foci as the\nends and A is the length of semi major axis. LF is the distance between two foci. S is the sum of\nEuclidean distance calculated for every point from the two foci. The graphical representation of\nthe function is given in figure 4.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 177\nFigure 3 : Flowchart of the proposed Modified IMSRA scheme\nFigure 4: contour plot of elliptical weighting function\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 178\nThe cloud growth correction takes two consecutive IR images and makes rain/no rain distinction\nbased on the studies of Woodley and sancho (1971), Vicente et al. (1998) and Mahesh et al. (2014).\nIt was observed that expanding clouds or clouds with cold tops that are becoming colder increases\nthe rainfall rates and decaying clouds or clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce\nlittle or no rainfall. Under this assumption, cloud growth correction factor is applied to discriminate\nrain/no-rain situation. The correction factor is 0 when the cloud is becoming warmer and as 1 when\nthe cloud is becoming colder.\n15.4.1.4 Case Study\nFigure 5 shows the spatial comparison of rainfall estimates based on present IMSRA and after\ncorrection with TRMM-3B42 on 15 July 2014. The comparison suggests that the over estimation\ntendencies of IMSRA algorithm has reduced considerably by the correction scheme: central Indian\nregion and the Bay of Bengal region shows the improvement in the improved version. Orographic\nregions also show significant improvement by the application of IMSRA correction scheme and\nthe inherent under estimation tendencies have reduced in corrected version of IMSRA.\n(a) (b) (c)\nFigure 5: Intercomparison of average daily rainfall estimates (mm h-1)on 15 July 2014 from (a)\nTRMM-3B42 (b) Operational IMSRA (c) IMSRA after correction scheme\n15.4.1.5 Preliminary Statistical Comparison with TRMM-3B42\nPreliminary validation of IMSRA rain estimates before and after correction is carried out from\njune to august 2014.

Validation\nRainfall products from the operational algorithms are to be obtained from two different methods\nmentioned above. These are required to be used for many diverse meteorological, climate,\nhydrological, agricultural, and other applications. It is therefore important to have an idea of their\naccuracy and expected error characteristics. This is done by validating the satellite precipitation\nestimates against \"ground truth\" from rain gauge and radar observations. A thorough verification\nof satellite-based precipitation products should quantify their accuracy in a wide range of weather\nand climate regimes, give users information on the expected errors in the estimates, help algorithm\ndevelopers understand the strengths and weaknesses of the satellite rainfall algorithms. To get good\nestimates of absolute accuracy satellite products are verified against very high quality radar and\ngauge data. However, these sites are only few in number. To get estimates of regional and spatial\naccuracy it is necessary to use a much larger quantity of data, for example, from national rain\ngauge networks. While these verification data are less reliable than those from high-quality sites,\ntheir errors are usually much smaller than those associated with the satellite estimates, at least on\nshort time scales. For validation of QPE with the ground truth on different temporal and spatial\nscale are required mainly with the data of DWR and Rain Gauges.\nFinally the retrieved rainfall from earlier steps and Rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data\non available locations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the algorithm.\nThe error analysis will be carried out and accordingly the algorithm will be fine tuned. A complete\nerror statistics (regression, correlation, RMSE, BIAS, Mean, Standard Deviation etc.) will be\nperformed for the desired period (validation period of about 3-4 months).\nRainfall maps on every 1/2 hourly and daily basis on pixel and any desired bigger grid spacing\nwill be produced with all provisions to have maximum possible information (like contours, color\nshades, statistical information etc.). Based on this algorithm QPE on daily, pentad, monthly mean,\nseasonal mean and annual mean will be produced. The capability of to derive QPE from IMSRA\nover meteorological subdivisions will be attempted along with Image Analysis System Group.\nAccordingly the algorithm will be made operational after due testing and validation.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 182\n15.6.1.

Method of Validation:\nCurrently pulsed Doppler technique are applied in weather radars to map severe storm reflectivity\nand velocity structure with great success in showing in real time the development of cyclones\nproviding quantitative measure of intensity, track and information on winds within and around the\nstorm. By studying the characteristics of radar returns and analyzing the variations in their\namplitude (or power received) , phase or frequency shift or change in polarization state, DWR\nquantifies the different characteristics of the precipitating medium within the pulse volume. The\namount of received power from the distributed target depends on the number of particles within\nthe pulse volume of the beam, their size, composition, shape, orientation etc.\nThe DWR‚Äôs are located at various sites all over the country. All are working operationally. DWR‚Äôs\nestimates 3 base products namely Reflectivity (Z), Velocity (V) and Spectrum Width (W) as a\nfunction of range. From these base products, advanced data products are required to be generated\nto meet the validation needs.\nGround-based radar and gauge rainfall observations (from IMD, ISRO‚Äôs AWS etc), at high\nresolution (hourly), are thus required to be used for validating rain product. High resolution IMD\nDWR products (hourly 4 Km x 4 Km) is required for evaluation over several small size study sites\nwith hourly (daily when hourly is not available) rain-gauge density, for instance in 1¬∞x 1¬∞ degrees.\nThe size of every validation study site varies from 0.5¬∞x 0.5¬∞ to 2¬∞x 2¬∞ degrees, depending on the\ndensity and distribution of available hourly rain-gauge stations over the study site and horizontal\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 183\nrain extents. In case of proper validation of GPI rainfall in particular, which is for a grid size of\n1.00 x1.00, there should be minimum 3 rain gauges (IMD or AWS) to average out for comparison\nwithin a GPI grid size. For IMSRA, an hourly, and daily DWR and rain gauge information would\nbe required on routine basis, preferably in 0.250x0.250 or atleast in 0.5¬∞x0.5¬∞ grids.\nPre-launch Field Experiments\nPre-launch validation campaign were launched earlier for existing Kalpana, INSAT-3A based\nrainfall algorithms as a prelude to INSAT-3D, 3DR. A three months period will be selected (mainly\nrainy season) for collecting data from DWRs, all possible and quality assured rain gauges and the\nalgorithm will be tested.\nPost-Launch Special Field Experiments\nMany of the present ground-truth observations data networks are being augmented for the\nmeasurements of precipitation on ground. This includes the plans of IMD to put more DWR in\nvarious Indian regions. However, the existing ground based data sources will be utilized for the\nINSAT-3D Imager derived rainfall estimates. Some more details of the validation campaigns\n(timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) will be decided later in mutual consultation with IMD.\n15.7. Merged Rain Products (IMSRA and Rain Gauges):\nTo merge in situ rainfall data from the AWS rain gauges with INSAT-3D derived IMSRA rainfall\nestimates, one of the simplest and state-of-the-art techniques, called the successive correction\nmethod (Cressman, 1959; Thiebaux and Pedder, 1987) has been found suitable enough for\nobjective analysis,. It involves the successive modification of satellite rainfall estimates based on\nobserved rain gauge rainfall data. The objective analysis scheme benefits from the relative\nadvantages of satellite and in situ data. In this method, the background field is corrected by the\nobserved values iteratively during several analysis scans until the correction between the\ninterpolated value and actual observation converges (Gairola et al. 2015). The interpolated weights\nare computed using the distance-dependent scheme and the correction (C) (Cressmaqn 1959) is\ndone using the following equation:\nC = ( ‚àëW (P0 ‚Äì Pp)) / N (1)\nwhere Po is rainfall at the observation point, Pp is the interpolated grid point data at observation\npoint, N is the number of observations, and the weight (W) is given by\nW= (R2 ‚Äì d2) / (R2 + d2) for d2 ‚â§ R2\n= 0 for d2 > R2 (2)\nwhere R is the radius of rainfall influence and d is the distance of the in situ data point from the\ngrid point. The appropriate radius of rainfall influence is determined by the spatial autocorrelation\nanalysis of daily IMSRA derived rainfall data. In recent study by Gairola et al. 2015), the objective\nanalysis applied for rainfall estimates show noticeable improvement over the satellite-based\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 184\nrainfall estimates. Comparison with independent rain gauge observations shows a considerable\nimprovement in terms of correlation, bias and root-mean-square error after objective analysis,\nespecially over the regions where density of rain gauge is fairly good. Overall results reveal that\nthe synergistic use of satellite and in situ observations has potential for more accurate rainfall\nestimations over the Indian monsoon region.\nFlow Chart for Merged Rain Products (IMSRA and Rain Gauges)\nIMSRA Rainfall (from Flow\nChart in Fig 3)\nObjective Analysis Daily National Rain\nGauge Data\nMerged Daily Rainfall\nFig. 5.

Major Conclusions\nÔÇ∑ The overestimation tendencies of IMSRA Rain can be considerably reduced by new scheme\n(Cloud growth & global bias correction).\nÔÇ∑ Orographic region shows significant improvement by the climatological orographic bias\ncorrection.\nÔÇ∑ Finally the merged rainfall over India from IMSRA and surface rain gauge data shows the\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 185\nimproved rain estimates at a 0.1¬∫ latitude √ó 0.1¬∫ longitude spatial resolution.\nÔÇ∑ While the modified IMSRA rain products will be available after every half hourly, the merged\nproducts will be generated every next day for daily rainfall subject to the availability of rain\ngauge data from IMD.\n15.8. Future Scope\nDue to the heterogeneity of precipitation over the Earth‚Äôs surface it is important that corrections\nbe applied time to time to the algorithms depending on region specific processes. Conventional\nmeans are restricted primarily to certain-land regions, and although satellite measurements are now\ncommonly available, these have limitations too. Frequent observations from visible (VIS) and\ninfrared (IR) sensors are hindered by the fact that estimates of precipitation are indirect and\ntherefore prone to errors caused by cloud-top to surface rainfall variations. More direct\nmeasurements of precipitation through the use of passive microwave (PMW) instruments are\nsomewhat restricted due their relative infrequent sampling of precipitation. Thus the algorithms\nfor merging of microwave data with IR images to generate rainfall rates at the spatial and temporal\nresolutions of the IR sensor is highly desirable. The combined approaches can improve rainfall\nestimates using the temporal sampling of the VIS/IR data and the more direct nature of the\nmicrowave estimates, avoiding the mentioned weaknesses and re-inforce the mutual strengths. At\npresent we have proposed to use Geostationary optical channels and low earth orbiting microwaves\nfor the rainfall estimation by their inter-calibration process and finally validations with the ground\ntruth. In future this approach can be further advanced by optimally integrating optical and\nmicrowave measurements by proper data assimilation schemes which will provide better rainfall\nthan any of the sensors (optical, microwave and ground truth) alone.\nIn future sensitivity studies could be made to estimate rainfall over the Indian monsoon region by\nthe synergistic use of the geostationary INSAT-3D -derived IMSRA rainfall estimates and rain data\nfrom GPM Microwave Radiometer (GMI), using a suitable objective analysis method. This will\nbenefit from high spatial and temporal resolutions of the geostationary satellite and infrequent but\nmore accurate microwave based rainfall estimates.\nReferences\nAdler, R. F., and A. J.

Introduction\nThis document describes the land surface reflectance retrieval algorithm for the MIR spectral band\n(3.8-4.0 ¬µm) of Imager sensor of INSAT-3DR. MIR reflectance consists of both reflective and\nemissive parts. Previous studies have shown that, full radiance (reflective and emissive) can not\nbe used for the studies involving global studies, where temperature gradients are due to the\nlatitudinal/topographical variations. We remove the emissive component using the brightness\ntemperature computed from the 11 ¬µm channel and making simple assumptions about the\nemissivities and transmittivities in both the channels, i.e. MIR and 11 ¬µm. These assumptions are\nfound to be conservative in the expected range of temperatures(T > 290 K). More appropriate\nvalues of emissivities and transmittivities would be adopted in the subsequent version of the\nalgorithm, which would evolve with time and experimentation. This algorithm is analyzed through\nthe comparison with the collocated and synchronous MODIS/METEOSAT surface reflectance\nproducts.\n16.2.1. Overview and background\nMid-IR channel on Imager can be utilized for the detection of dark dense vegetation, burned areas\netc., which can be used for land use/cover dynamics related studies. Red and NIR channels are\ntraditionally used for detecting burned areas. However, these channels are highly affected by the\naerosol scattering and absorption caused by the biomass burning (Kaufman and Remer, 1994), and\nhence affects the values of NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). MIR part of the\nspectrum is also sensitive for the changes in the state of the vegetation (due to active chlorophyll\nassociated with liquid water in the leaves), but it is virtually unaffected by the presence of most of\nthe types of aerosols (except dust). Monitoring the MIR reflectance can help to study the vegetation\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 193\ncover more reliably. However, MIR reflectance should be used with caution for the studies\nperformed over global scales, only reflected component of the MIR should be utilized (Libonati et\nal., 2010). The emitted component of the signal may not represent the intrinsic properties of the\nsurface. We remove the emissive component using the brightness temperature computed from the\n11 ¬µm channel of INSAT-3DR and making simple assumptions about the emissivities and\ntransmittivity in both the channels, i.e. MIR and 11 ¬µm.\n16.2.2.

Introduction\nThe process of evapotranspiration (ET) acts as one of the main drivers of the hydrological or water\ncycle. One of the distinguishing factors of ET is its role as a key player between the energy and\nwater cycles. The potential ET rate (ET ) is influenced by several factors such as solar radiation,\no\nwind speed, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Among them, solar radiation is the most\nsensitive parameter influencing almost 60-70% variability of ET . The potential evapo-\no\ntranspiration (PET), hereafter referred as grass reference evapo-transpiration (ET ),is expressed in\no\nterms of amount of water transferred per unit time to atmosphere from water non-limiting surface\ncovered with a uniformly and actively growing short grass such as Alfalfa. ET represents the\no\nevaporative demand of the atmosphere for a given climatic region. Deficiency in required supply\nof moisture leads to water stress. Reference evapo-transpiration is an agrometeorological variable\nwidely used in hydrology and agriculture. Together with precipitation, it is a major input in soil\nwater balance models. Several of these models require daily or hourly evapo-transpiration data to\nprovide acceptable estimate of plants‚Äô water requirements. This would provide regional water\ndemand in different agro-climatic settings and agricultural growing season. The combination of\nspatial rainfall with ET would help in monitoring water deficit and surplus during a growing\no\nseason for rainfed agriculture.\nSome contours of monthly climatic ET have been generated by Department of Agricultural\no\nMeteorology, IMD (India Meteorological Department) from measurements of limited surface\nobservatories in India. But interpolation from such contours will propagate large errors. No digital\nmap of ET is available to scientific community, modelers, resource managers and planners in\no\nIndia. Moreover, real-time updated spatial ET product at weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and monthly\no\nscales would aid in knowing the intra and inter-seasonal climatic variability of water stress factors\nand their impact on deviation in biomass and yield. The climatic moisture index (ratio of rainfall\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 200\nand PET) is essential to know surface wetness and suitability of sowing or transplanting operations.\nTherefore, it has the relevance for national agro-advisory services to farmers as well as crop\nforecasting.\n17.2.1. Overview and background\nThe latent heat of vaporization, which is the energy required for evaporating water is significant\nin weather and climate dynamics (Priestley & Taylor, 1972; Monteith,1973; Rowntree, 1991;\nAnderson et al., 2007). Although the concept of ‚Äúevaporation‚Äù has been known since\napproximately 500 B.C. (see Brutsaert, 1982 for a chronological sketch), most of the understanding\nof the governing factors has been achieved in the last two centuries. Dalton (1802) was the first\nwho proposed relationship of vapor pressure deficit (e ‚àíe ) of the near surface air to the\nsat act\nevaporation rate. Later, many empirical relationships were developed based on other\nenvironmental factors (Blaney and Criddle, 1950; Hargreaves, 1975; Thornthwaite, 1948). Based\non available energy considerations and turbulent flux theory, Penman (1948) developed his\nevaporation equation for natural surfaces for water non-limiting conditions. This is known as\npotential evapotranspiration (PET). Monteith (1964) developed a modified version of the Penman\nequation in which biophysics was introduced through a surface or canopy resistance ‚Äì the now\nwell-known Penman‚ÄìMonteith (P-M) combination equation ‚Äì that allowed for vegetation control\non transpiration rates.\nChoudhury (1997) proposed a method to assess by means of satellite data, such as remotely sensed\nsolar radiation, air temperature (derived from infrared images and weather station measurements)\nand vapor pressure deficit. This method provides good evapo-transpiration estimates for low-\nresolution applications such as worldwide scale and monthly time step. The accuracy is limited by\nthe high uncertainties provided by satellite-sensed vapor pressure estimation.\nLater, Bois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation from METEOSAT observations from\nHeliosat-2 approach (Rigollier et al. 2004) and air temperature data to estimate ET using\no\nHargreaves approach. The ET can also be available as forecast bi-product from weather\no\nforecasting model. However, recent evaluation of predicted radiative fluxes and operational short-\nrange forecasts (24 hrs average) of routine weather elements from model for a limited winter\nmonths showed that the incident shortwave radiative flux produced the highest root mean square\nerror to the tune of 110% (Bhattacharya et al, 2012a) amongst others as compared to in situ\nmeasurements from INSAT-linked micrometeorological stations (popularly known as AMS).\nHowever, the errors of short-range forecast of air temperatures, relative humidity, atmospheric\npressure, wind speed at 10 m height were 3%, 12%, 21% and 1.4% respectively over plain and\npleateu regions. The per cent RMSE for last four variables were found to increase in the hilly\nterrain (Bhattacharya et al, 2012a). Expectedly, the ET would have substantial errors propagated\n0\nmainly from incident solar radiation flux estimation. on the other hand, the operational product on\ndaily insolation from Kalpana-1 VHRR produced around 25% RMSE (Bhattacharya et al, 2012b)\nwith respect to same ground reference and the per cent RMSE decreased with averaging over\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 201\nweekly, ten-day, fortnightly and monthly scales up to 15%. After improvement in the cloud\nflagging and the spatial resolution of operational insolation product from INSAT 3D, it is expected\nto produce substantially less errors. Therefore, it seems wise to use the combination of daily\ninsolation product from INSAT 3D and operational forecasts of air temperatures, relative humidity,\nwind speed and atmospheric pressure to generate real-time digital and regional product of potential\nevapo-transpiration.\n17.2.2. Objectives\nThe objectives of this document are :\nÔÇ∑ To outline the algorithm for the estimation of potential evapo-transpiration (ET ) based on\no\nPenman-Monteith (P-M) approach (FAO-56 model)\nÔÇ∑ To integrate operational product of daily insolation from INSAT 3D and 24 hrs average\noperational forecast of routine weather elements at finer spatial resolution to generate\nproduct of spatial ET at 5 km spatial resolution\no\nÔÇ∑ To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval) chain for\nautomation of ET product generation\no\nÔÇ∑ To describe validation strategy against in-situ measurements with initial results\n17.2.3. Instrument and characteristics of input products\n17.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT 3D)\nThe Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of Space (DOS),\nDepartment of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological Department (IMD). INSAT\n3D is an exclusive meteorological satellite in the INSAT system, which was launched at\ngeostationary orbit in 2013. This radiometer consists of four bands : broad VIS (0.52-0.75), SWIR\n(1.55-1.70), MIR(3.8-4.0), WV(6.5-7.0) and two thermal TIR1(10.2-11.2), TIR2 (11.5-12.5) with\nnineteen sounder channel. The spatial resolution of VIS and SWIR band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km\nx 4 km for MIR, WV and two thermal IR bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data\nProcessing System (IMDPS) provides both ‚Äòfull-globe‚Äô and ‚Äòsector‚Äô data products in all the bands\nat half-an-hour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So, there are maximum\n48 acquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition were corrected for\nservo, line-loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using the INSAT 3D data products\nscheduler. This results into automated generation of co-registered data in each band at Transverse\nMercator (TM) projection. The dimension of each band at each acquisition is 676 rows x 721\ncolumns for Asia Mercator sector product.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 202\n17.2.3.2. Operational insolation product\nA spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to determine\nintegrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-hourly observations\nfrom an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3D, were used to provide minimum ground\nbrightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30 days, cloud top albedo, brightness\ntemperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to these models in addition to global eight-day\naerosol optical depth at 550 nm and columnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme was implemented to\nobtain daily insolation (in MJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout\nthe day for all-sky conditions (clear + cloudy). The whole algorithm (Bhattacharya et al, 2010 &\n2012b) will be operationalized and daily insolation product can available at 4 km spatial resolution\nwith Transverse Mercator projection routinely from MOSDAC site (http://www.mosdac.gov.in).\n17.2.3.3. Operational product of WRF short-range forecast\nWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is used for\nAll India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic, primitive equation\nmodel with multiple options for various physical parameterization schemes. This version employs\nArakawa C-grid staggering for the horizontal grid and a fully compressible system of equations.\nThe terrain following hydrostatic pressure co-ordinate with vertical grid stretching is followed in\nvertical. The time-split integration uses 3rd order Runge-Kutta scheme with a smaller time step for\nacoustic and gravity wave modes. The WRF physical options used in this proposal consists of the\nWRF Single Moment 6-class simple ice scheme for microphysics (WSM6); the Grell-Devenyi\nensemble cumulus convection parameterization scheme; and the Yonsei University (YSU)\nplanetary boundary layer scheme.\nThe WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal resolution of 45\nkm, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260√ó235, 352√ó373 and 676√ó721 in x and\ny directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The model has 36 vertical levels with the top\nof the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The WRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all\navailable conventional including ISRO-AWS data and satellite observations to improve the model\ninitial conditions. The operational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at\nMOSDAC site used climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database\nand assimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS and satellite observations (Kumar\net al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011) from Indian and other International agencies (e.g. EUMETCast).\nThe operational forecast is available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at three hourly interval upto\n72 hours.\nExamples of operational daily insolation product and 24 hrs average WRF forecast product of air\ntemperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure over Indian region are shown\nin Figure 1.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 203\nFigure 1.

Algorithm functional specifications\nIn 1948, Penman combined the energy balance with the mass transfer and derived an equation to\ncompute the evaporation from an open water surface from standard meteorological records of\nsunshine, temperature, humidity and wind speed. This combination method was further extended\nto vegetated surface by introducing resistance term. The aerodynamic and surface resistances have\nbeen added to the original equation of Penman to estimate Potential evapotranspiration (ET ) from\no\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 205\na surface.

After that, gradual rise in September coincident to higher\ninsolation due to with drawl of monsoon. The ET again decreases in October and November but\no\nthere is rise in western part of India during December due to increase in day length in last dekad\nof December.\n17.7.1. Sensitivity of P-M model to weather variables for error budgeting\nThe sensitivity of P-M model ET was carried out by Bois et al (2008) using ‚ÄòSobol‚Äô method. It\n0\nconsists of numerous simulations of the models using two independent samples of ‚ÄòN‚Äô repetitions\n(rows) and ‚Äòk‚Äô input variables (columns), retrieved from existing data or randomly generated data\nfrom the probability distribution function (PDF) of each ‚Äòk‚Äô input variable. One or several variables\nin the first sample are substituted by the same variable (s) taken from the second sample. For each\nof the (2k - 1) possible combinations of variable substitutions between the two samples, ‚ÄòN‚Äô runs\nof the model are computed. The sensitivity of the model to input variables was based on so-called\nsensitivity or Sobol‚Äô indices, which were calculated on the principle of the decomposition of the\ntotal variance (V) of the model output, in response to individual or simultaneous variations of the\n‚Äòk‚Äô model inputs.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 212\nFigure 3. Example of monthly distribution of ET from VHRR insolation and WRF forecasts over\n0\nIndian region\nIn oceanic climate, the results of monthly sensitivity analyses computed using Southwest area\n(SW) data show clear seasonal trends (Figure 4). During the winter period (from November to\nFebruary), wind speed is the main source of variation in ET values calculated using P-M method\n0\n(e.g. 38% of ET total variance in January). Then come relative humidity and air temperature (32%\n0\nand 17% of ET total variance in January, respectively). Solar radiation, daily amplitude of air\n0\ntemperature and daily amplitude of relative humidity have little impact on evapo-transpiration\nprocess during winter. This trend changes during March and October. From April to September,\nET is mostly sensitive to solar radiation (up to 74% of ET total variance in May, and 70% in\n0 0\nJuly). From May to July, P-M formula is not very sensitive to relative humidity, air temperature\nand their diurnal amplitudes. Mean daily air temperature participate from 11% to 15% of ET\n0\nvariance, from May to September. Total sensitivity indices show that, when added to other\nvariables‚Äô variations, air temperature has a greater impact on ET variability during summer, and\n0\nwind speed has a greater impact during winter (Figure 4B).\nIn Mediterranean climate, sensitivity of ET computation to climate input variables using P-M\n0\nmethod in Southeast area (SE) is very close to the one observed. Wind speed as a major impact on\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 213\nET calculation during winter and solar radiation is clearly the most influent variable during\n0\nsummer (Figure 4C and D). The present analysis highlights the great sensitivity of this Penman‚Äì\nMonteith formula to solar radiation during summer period, when ET reaches its highest values,\n0\nand when its calculation is critical for irrigation process and ecological modelling. These results\nwere obtained for Mediterranean and Oceanic climate, at medium latitudes. A recent work\npublished by Gong et al. (2006) on a large range of climatic conditions in Southern China leads to\nsimilar results, except for relative humidity which had a greater impact on ET during winter than\n0\nit has been shown in the present study. Considering the results of Penman‚ÄìMonteith sensitivity to\nsolar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to\nET calculation.\n0\nFigure 4.

Preliminary comparison with in-situ measurements\nThe daily insolation product (Bhattacharya et al., 2012b) from K1VHRR available through\nMOSDAC (Meteorological and Oceanic Satellite Data Archival Centre) for the period January 1,\n2011 to December 31, 2011 to derive radiation parameters and other routine inputs from WRF\nforecast were ingested into P-M model to generate daily, dekadal (ten-day) and monthly ET\n0\nestimates at regional scale following the steps mentioned in section 4.12. To validate satellite based\nregional ET estimates, the measurements from INSAT-linked AMS (Agro-Met-Station) data were\no\nused (Bhattacharya et al, 2009). The AMS provides all radiation and meteorological variables at\n30 minutes interval and represent a fetch area of 1 km x 1 km. The AMS data from six sites over\ndifferent agro-climatic zones were used to compute ET on daily basis for different time period as\no\nlisted in Table 6. The ET was calculated on daily basis using AMS half-an-hour average\no\nmeasurements.\nTable 6.

The 1:1 plot is shown in\nFigure 5 and temporal comparison is shown in Figure 6. The daily ET computed from AMS varied\no\nfrom 0.7 mm to 12.0 mm while satellite derived ET varied from 1.1 to 11.7 mm over different\no\nseasons for selected stations. The error analysis showed the root mean square deviation (RMSD)\nvaried from 1.13 to 3.82 mmd-1 to the tune of 21 to 38 % of measured mean over six stations (Table\n7). The overall pooled data set showed RMSD of 1.34 mmd-1 with 29% deviation from measured\nmean. This was due to high fluctuation of ET on daily temporal scale as shown in Figure 5 for all\no\nsix AMS stations. The estimated daily ET showed underestimation as well as overestimation for\no\nall AMS stations but extent of temporal pattern matches quite well in all the stations.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 216\nFigure 5. 1:1 scatter plot between daily ET from AMS and estimates from satellite and WRF\no\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 217\n(f)\nFigure 6.

The rise and fall of\ncomputed ET was well captured in estimated ET during January to April.

The dekadal temporal profile of\nestimated ET matched well with AMS ET but showed small amount of deviation during April.\no o\nThis may be due to application of irrigation water in rice crop and was only captured in computed\nET from AMS but not reflected in estimated ET . The temporal variation of dekadal ET was 28\no o o\nto 30 mm in January with gradual rise in February. The maximum ET was observed in April due\no\nto rise in temperature and radiation load. This seasonal change of ET was well captured in the\no\nestimates. The overall RMSD was found to be 10.5 mm (27.4 % of AMS mean) on January to\nApril with respect to AMS.\nThe central plateau and hill agro-climatic region is represented here by AMS at Powarkheda site.\nThe area falls under the catchment of Narmada where annual rainfall varies from 800 to 1200 mm.\nThe wheat crop is dominant during rabi season. The estimated dekadal ET estimates matched well\no\nthroughout January to May. The dekadal high and low value matched quite well and estimated ET\no\nalways remained high as compared to AMS ET up to March during growth of wheat crop. After\no\nthat, estimated ET underestimated measured ET .

The temporal profiles matched quite well and showed RMSD of 10.4 mm over ten days\n(16.6% deviation from AMS mean).\nThe typical Indian arid region lies in western, dry agro-climatic region and represented here by\nJaisalmer. The climate remains hot throughout the year except in January and February. The data\nover monsoon season (July, August and September) were used for computation of ET . In this part\no\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 220\nof India, S-W monsoon starts in July and it was well captured by dekadal ET variation during\no\nstated months.

The data showed a RMSD\nof 9.4 mm (21.4% deviation of measured AMS mean).\nThe island agroclimatic region of Andaman & Nicobar have different climatic conditions as\ncompared to above stated regions. As this region is surrounded by Bay of Bengal so climatic\ncondition remains humid throughout the year. The data from March to May and August to\nNovember were used for comparison.

Error analysis of ET for variable-time accumulation\no\nThe daily estimated and AMS ET was compared for different time windows viz. 3-day, 5-day, 7-\no\nday and 10-day. The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured ET gradually\no\nincreased from daily to 10-day but maximum increase was observed from daily to 7-day i.e from\n8% to 23% for six AMS stations. The rise of correlation coefficient from 7-day to 10 days was\nnominal in Nariangarh (PAU) (0.7%), Chakdah (BCKV) (2%), Pawarkheda (2.3%) and Jaisalmer\n(6.3%) as compared to LPSC (Mahandergiri) (13.8%) and Diglipur (12.6%) as shown in Figure 8.\nSimilarly per cent deviation from mean of AMS measurements also showed a similar trend as the\ndeviation drastically came down from daily to 7-days and further nominal decrease in 10-day\nexcept than in Jaisalmer. For the latter, it decreases from 14.8% to 10.2% for 7 to 10-days as\nmarked in Figure 9. The analysis showed that error was significantly reduced from daily to 7-days\nand further in 10-days over different agro-climatic zones. This will help us use this ET data in\no\nvarious applications on different time scales with known errors.\nFigure 9. Error analysis of ET for variable-time accumulation\no\n17.7.1.4. Comparison of errors from similar studies elsewhere\nConsidering the results of Penman‚ÄìMonteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to\nevaluate the benefits of satellite-sensed solar radiation to estimate spatial ET as no regular spatial\no\nrecord are available for solar radiation. Choudhury (1997) attempted monthly global ET at 0.25o\no\nx 0.25o from P-M method using solar radiation from International Satellite Cloud Climatology\nProject (ISCCP). He derived vapour pressure and vapour pressure deficit (VPD) from TIROS\noperational vertical sounder TOVS data with air temperature based on interactive GCM forecast\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 224\nretrieval assimilation system applied to the TOVS data. He has compared the estimated ET with\no\nlysimeter data and on monthly scale the error was found between 15 to 40% from measured mean.\nBois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation and weather data from AWS equipped with\nhumidity, thermal sensors and cup anemometer to estimate ET using FAO-56 P-M method. They\no\nused the solar radiation prepared from Meteosat data by following Heliosat-2 method (Rigollier et\nal. 2004). The study found that most of the errors occurred in partial cloudy days due to\nuncertainties in retrieving daily solar radiation. On daily scale, the RMSD was between 0.34 to\n1.32 mm (11% to 110% from daily mean) but on annual scale the RMSD remained low (11% of\nET mean value) at 0.05o X 0.05o spatial resolution. This error again came down to (9.1% to 5%\no\nof ET mean value) during clear days in summer. Our study was unique as we used operational\no\nproduct of K1VHRR insolation WRF 3-hourly forecast for at 0.05¬∞grid for estimation of ET at\no\n0.08o X 0.08o. On daily scale, RMSD was 1.1 to 3.8 mm (21% to 38% from measured mean) but\nit came down to 10% to 28% from mean on dekadal time scale and further in monthly scale (21%\nfrom monthly mean). The overall error at different temporal domain were found in good harmony\nwith reported errors in other part of world.\n17.8. Sources of errors / uncertainties in ET estimates and validation issues\no\nThe following sources of uncertainties were traced out while evaluating spatial output of ET\no\nestimates and its comparison with ground reference\n(i) Influence of vegetation in AMS\nThe FAO 56 P-M method is generally applied for a specific site using meteorological and radiation\ndata from meteorological observatories or AWS weather data including direct measurement of\nradiation. In India, ISRO-AWS does not provide solar radiation data in terms of standard energy\nunits. IMD AWS provide data with some lag period. The sensitivity analysis of P-M method by\nGong et al. (2006) and Bois et al. (2008) highlighted that solar radiation and wind speed were\nclearly the most influent variables for ET estimation. The pyranometer and routine weather data\no\nfrom AMS are used. But these measurements were recorded over different vegetation cover types.\nSince vegetation growth influences ambient weather conditions, the ET computed from AMS\no\nwould definitely have differential vegetation influence when compared to ET estimates from\no\nintegration of satellite based solar radiation and WRF forecast weather variables.\n(ii) Scale mismatch\nSpatial ET was generated at approximately 8 km spatial resolution with 64 km2 pixel area while\no\nthe average footprint of AMS varies from 0.25 to 1 km2. This scale mismatch puts constrain in\nvalidation statistics. But this scale mismatch will reduced with INSAT 3D.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 225\n(iii) Difference in time sampling\nFor spatial ET , daily solar radiation was generated from diurnal observations at instantaneous\no\nsnapshots with half-an-hour interval from satellite platform. But half-an-hourly averages from\nAMS measurements were used to generate validation datasets\n(iv) Accuracy in cloud flagging\nThe product version of surface insolation algorithm has cloud detection capability of\napproximately 80%. It could not detect thinner clouds. Therefore, ET estimates have higher errors\no\nduring the period more cloudy spells or for AMS sites with higher cloud dynamics such as Diglipur\n(A & N), LPSC, Mahendragiri etc.\n(v) Quality of WRF forecast\nAn initial evaluation of WRF forecast quality showed an average error to the tune of 1-2¬∞C, RH of\n5-10% as compared to large error in wind speed and predicted radiation terms. The inherent errors\nin first three variables will have implications on the overall error budget.\n17.9. Future scope of improvement\nRecent improvement has taken place in the cloud detection of INSAT 3D insolation algorithm\nusing additional criteria based on cloudiness index from VIS band observations. Much of the\nuncertainties in insolation and ET estimates in cloudy-skies will hopefully be improved.\no\nRecent study on impact of updated vegetation fraction from INSAT 3A CCD showed improvement\nin air temperature, humidity and rainfall forecast from WRF. The use of real-time satellite based\nother land surface products such as albedo, LAI and soil moisture would definitely help in\nimproving the quality of operational forecasts. Future work should address the retrieval /\nestimation of those variables from Indian geostationary satellites.\nThe INSAT 3D will provide relatively finer spatial resolution of observation of insolation. This\nwould reduce the scale mismatch uncertainty for validation.\nINSAT-3D Incremental ATBD (MMDRPS), November 2018 226\nReferences\nAllen, R., Pereira, L., Raes, D., Smith, M., 1998.

This\nformat document is valid for Level-1, Level-2 and Level-3 products.\n1.2 Purpose and Objectives\nThis document serves as a format document for the INSAT-3D data products in HDF5 Format.\nThe reader should note that this document does not discuss the structures underlying HDF or the\nspecific conventions employed. For more information on HDF, its design philosophy, and its\nlogical and physical formats, the reader is referred to NCSA website [1]. The HDF5 library and\nutilities (provided by NCSA) can be used to read the contents of the HDF products.\n1.3 INSAT-3D Payloads\nThe INSAT-3D spacecraft (parked at 82¬∞ East) carries two meteorological payloads: (i) Imager\nworking from the visible to the infrared spectral bands (0.55 to 12.5 ¬µm) and (ii) Sounder\nworking in 18 IR (7 in LWIR,5 in MWIR,6 in SWIR) channels and one in Visible spectral range.\nBrief specification of Imager and Sounder are as follows.\nIMAGER\nThe IMAGER provides imaging capability of the earth disk from geostationary altitude in one\nVisible (VIS) in 0.55 to 0.75 ¬µm range and five infrared channels. The specifications of the\npayload are summarized in Table 1.2.1.\nThere are two flexible modes of operations possible with the IMAGER payloads:\nÔÇ∑ Full frame mode scans 18¬∞ E-W x 18¬∞N-S covering the entire earth disk and some space\naround. The acquisition time for full globe is around 26 minutes. So daily 48 acquisitions\nare possible in every half hourly interval.\nÔÇ∑ Program mode covering 18¬∞ in E-W direction; N-S coverage can be defined in terms of\nthe number of lines to be scanned\n1\nTable 1.1 Payload Specification for IMAGER\nSpectral Spectral Range Resolution (km) Quantization\nChannels (¬µm) bits\nVIS 0.55 ‚Äì 0.75 1 10\nSWIR 1.55-1.70 1 10\nMIR 3.80-4.00 4 10\nWV 6.50-7.10 8 10\nTIR 1 10.3-11.3 4 10\nTIR 2 11.5 ‚Äì 12.5 4 10\nSOUNDER\nThe Sounder onboard INSAT 3D has 18 Infra Red channels, out of which 7 are in long wave IR\n(LWIR), 6 in short wave IR (SWIR) and 5 in medium wave IR (MWIR) bands and 1 Visible\nChannel.\nTable 1.2 Payload Specification for Sounder\nSpectral Spectral Resolution Quantization\nChannels Range (¬µm) (km) Bits\nVISIBLE 0.67 ‚Äì 0.72 10 12\nSWIR (6 Channels) 3.67 ‚Äì 4.59 10 14\nMWIR (5 Channels) 6.38 ‚Äì 11.33 10 14\nLWIR (7 Channels) 11.66 ‚Äì 14.85 10 14\n1.4 INSAT-3D Data Products Types\nSupported data products as given as:\nTable: 1.3 INSAT-3D Data Product Levels and Types\nProduct Processing Corrections Applied Format/Remarks\nDescription level\nStandard LEVEL 1B Radiometrically corrected (Line loss HDF5\nCorrections correction, Failed detector correction\nand RAD LUT applied)\nStandard LEVEL 1C Radiometric + Geometric correction HDF5\nCorrections with applied (Geo-referenced)\nGeo-referencing\nGeo-physical LEVEL 2B Geophysical parameters derived from HDF5\nParameter L1B\nGeo-physical LEVEL2G Geophysical Parameters Gridded at a HDF5\nParameter pre-defined Resolution\n2\nGeo-physical LEVEL2P Geophysical Parameters provided as HDF5/ KML\nParameter Point Datasets\nGeo-physical LEVEL 3B Binned Geophysical Parameters HDF5\nParameter derived from L2B\nGeo-physical LEVEL3G Binned Geophysical Parameters HDF5\nParameter derived from L2G\n1.5 Product File Naming Convention\nThe hdf5 product file name is coined as:\nSSNNN_DDMMMYYYY_HHmm_LOP_XXX.h5\nWhere\nSS=Satellite ID (e.g. 3D for INSAT-3D)\nNNN=Sensor ID (IMG for Imager, SND for Sounder)\nDDMMMYYYY=Date of Acquisition (DD=Day of Month, MMM=Month of the year, YYYY=\nyear of Pass e.g. 23MAY2012)\nHHmm=Time of Acquistion (HH=Hour of day mm=minute of the hour)\nLOP=Level of Processing (L1B, L1C, L2B)\nXXX=Parameter Name (See Table 1.5) or STD or Sector Name (See Table 1.4) e.g.\n3DIMG_26SEP2012_0730_L1B_STD.h5\nTable 1.4 Sector Name and Mnemonics\nSr. Sector Name Mnemonics Description/ Remark SENSOR\nNo\n1 ASIA_MER ASI_MER IMAGER\n2 SGP SGP Area Of Interest (AOI)\n3 SA1 SA1 based Products SOUNDER\n4 SB1 SB1\nTable 1.5 Geo-physical Parameter Name and Mnemonics\nSr. Geo-physical Parameter Name SENSOR Level Mnemonics\nNo\nPer Pixel Products (IMAGER)\n1.

A field name\n‚ÄúRadiometric_Calibration_Type‚Äù provided as attribute of Root Group in HDF product describes\nsource of calibration coefficients used for generating this LUT (Ref Table 2.3).\nCALIBRATION COEFFICIENTS\nLab and Online radiometric calibration coefficients are available as part of HDF product, which\ncan be used for computing radiance directly from count:\nÔÇ∑ Lab Calibration coefficients are generated using pre-launch ground test data, where each IR\ndetector element along with its associated processing channel is characterized in Thermo-\nvacuum chamber using two Blackbody targets-a Space Reference Target (SRT) simulating\nspace and a Variable Temperature Blackbody Source (VTBS) simulating the earth scene\nfrom 180K to 340K temperature range. Using these data quadratic coefficients (slope, offset\nand quadratic term) for EOM 10¬∞C, 25¬∞C and 40¬∞C were generated. Based on EOM\ntemperature of an acquisition lab slope, offset and quadratic term are derived and provided in\nproduct.\nIn HDF products a field named ‚Äúinvert‚Äù (provided as attribute of each channel dataset)\nindicates whether image counts are inverted or not. While computing the radiance values the\ncounts should be inverted (only for bands having invert = True) .The lab coefficients\nprovided for Count to radiance conversion are used in following way:\nCount = DN - Count (only if invert = True)\nMax\nWhere DN 1023 for Imager and DN = 16383 for Sounder\nMax Max\nR (in mw cm-2 sr-1 um-1) = lab_radiance_quad*(Count)2 +\nlab_radiance_scale_factor*(Count) + lab_radiance_add_offset\nÔÇ∑ Online calibration is performed using onboard internal blackbody serving as a \"hot target\"\nand space view count as \"cold target\". From these two online slope and offset are computed.\nQuadratic term is derived using inter sensor calibration.\n22\nIn HDF products a field named invert indicates inversion of image counts. While computing\nthe radiance values the counts should be inverted (only for bands having invert = True) . The\nonline coefficients provided for Count to radiance conversion are used in following way:\nCount = DN - Count (only if invert == true)\nMax\nWhere DN 1023 for Imager and DN = 16383 for Sounder\nMax Max\nR (in mw cm-2 sr-1 um-1)=online_radiance_quad *(Count)2 +\nonline_radiance_scale_factor*(Count)+online_radiance_add_offset\nCOUNT TO BRIGHTNESS TEMPERATURE\nCount can be converted to Brightness Temperature (BT) using 2 methods:\nÔÇ∑ Using LUT provided in the product (XXXX_YYY_TEMP, where XXXX is Sensor YYY is\nBand).\nÔÇ∑ First convert count to radiance as discussed above and then generate BT from radiance using\ninverse planck's law as given below.\nbrightness_temperature = C2 / (cwl * log(C1 / (1.0E6 * rad_w_m2 * pow (cwn, 5.0)) + 1))\nWhere\ncwl(metres)= central_wavelength(um)/1000000.0 (Field central_wavelength in product)\nrad_w_m2 = radiance*10.0 (For converting from mw cm-2 sr -1 um-1 to w m-2 sr-1 um-1)\nh = 6.6260755e-34 kg m2 s-1;\nc = 2.9979246e+8 ms-1;\nk = 1.380658e-23 kg m2 s-2 k-1;\nC1 = 2.0 * h *c * c;\nC2 = (h * c) / k;\nRECOMMENDATION: It is recommended to use coefficients of type of calibration\n(Radiometric_Calibration_Type) to generate radiance from counts. The other calibration source\nat some times may have issues.\n23\nAppendix- II : INSAT-3D Geometric Calibration\n1.

Chapters 3 to 21 contain\nthe theoretical basis for the individual algorithms of various geophysical parameters except\nHSCAS and tropical cyclone. Algorithms for tropical cyclone position and intensity\nestimation system and snow analysis system are to be written jointly with IMD because\nderivation of these parameters needs large number of auxillary inputs and operational\nmeterological expertise. Discussion is going on with IMD for making these two algorithms.\nThe purpose of this document is to describe the scientific algorithms which will be used to\nextract the Meteorological Products from the pre-processed Level 1 image data acquired by\nthe Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) and 19 channel Sounder onboard INSAT-3D\nsatellite. VHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS), Near Infra-\nred (NIR), Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the spectrum covering\nthe following channels: VIS 0.6Œºm, NIR 1.6Œºm, MWIR 3.9Œºm, WV 6.7Œºm, IR 10.8Œºm, IR\n12.0Œºm. Each channel of the Imager has different resolution as mentioned in the following\nTable-1\nTable ‚Äì 1: INSAT-3D VHRR Specification\nChannel No Wavelength (ÔÅ≠m) Resolution (Km)\n1 0.55 - 0.75 1\n2 1.55 - 1.70 1\n3 3.8 - 4.0 4\n4 6.5 - 7.1 8\n5 10.2 - 11.3 4\n6 11.5 - 12.5 4\nINSAT-3D Sounder has 18 infrared channel and a visible channel to help cloud detection\nduring daytime.

Clouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower\ntemperature than the underlying earth surface. As such, simple visible and infrared window\nthreshold approaches offer considerable skill in cloud detection. However, there are many\nsurface conditions when this characterization of clouds is inappropriate, most notably over\nsnow and ice. Additionally, some cloud types such as thin cirrus, low stratus at night, and small\ncumulus are difficult to detect because of insufficient contrast with the surface radiance. Cloud\nedges cause further difficulty since the instrument field of view will not always be completely\ncloudy or clear.\nINSAT-3D VHRR will measure radiances in one visible and one SWIR band at 1 km spatial\nresolution, one MIR and two TIR bands at 4 km resolution, and one WV band at 8 km\nresolution. Radiances from 3 IR spectral bands TIR ‚Äì1 , TIR ‚Äì2 and MIR (Table 1) which are\nof same resolution of 4km are used in the INSAT cloud mask algorithm to estimate whether a\ngiven view of the earth surface is unobstructed by clouds.\nThis cloud mask parameter will be directly used for the retrieval of the following parameters:\nSST , UTH, Fire and Snow Cover. This will be partially used for retrieval of AOD where\nadditional test may be required with the visible data.\n2.2.1 Overview and background\nThe INSAT cloud mask algorithm benefits from several previous efforts to characterize global\ncloud cover using satellite observations. These algorithms have been used in global cloud\nclimatology over long time periods and thus have overcome some of the difficulties facing the\nINSAT cloud mask algorithm. A wide variety of scientists have discussed the physical basis\nbehind each of the spectral tests and applications to satellite or aircraft data are present in a\nvariety of publications (Ackerman et al. [1997]. The INSAT cloud mask algorithm builds on\nthese past works by combining the different tests into a single unified algorithm.\nOperational GOES products by NESDIS also require cloud detection, an algorithm referred\nto as ‚Äúcloud clearing.‚Äù In this application, an array of n√ón contiguous pixels is categorized as\nclear, cloudy or unusable. The clear arrays are subcategorized as truly clear and clear/cloudy.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 16\nCloud Mask\nIn an approach similar to the ITPP-5 method (Minnis et al 1995), clear conditions are\ndetermined based on brightness thresholds, difference thresholds, and comparison of\nobservations with first guess profiles.\n2.2.2 Objective\nThe objective of this algorithm is to discriminate the cloudy pixels from the clear pixel in the\nimage data.\n2.3 Inputs\n2.3.1 Static Data\nParameter Resolution Accuracy Source\nLand sea mask 4 km - USGS file (Available)\n2.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nNote:\nThe BTmax (11¬µ) for each time, user defined no. of previous days (default 20 days)\nimages of TIR ‚Äì1 and TIR-2 for all times of the day will be needed.

The new concept included here is to determine the threshold on the\nbasis of clear sky temperature determined by compositing the multi-date image data.\n2.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\nThe theoretical basis of the algorithms and practical considerations are contained in this\nsection. For nomenclature, we shall refer to the infrared radiance as brightness temperature\n(equivalent blackbody temperature determined using the Planck function) denoted as BT.\nSubscripts refer to the wavelength at which the measurement is made.\nClouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower temperature than the\nunderlying earth surface. Simple visible and infrared window threshold approaches offer\nconsiderable skill in cloud detection; however, many surface conditions reduce cloud surface\ncontrast in certain spectral regions, (e.g. bright clouds over snow and ice).\n2.4.1.2 Infrared Brightness Temperature Thresholds and Difference (BTD) Tests\nThe azimuthally averaged form of the infrared radiative transfer equation is given by\n(1)\nIn addition to atmospheric structure, which determines B(T), the parameters describing the\ntransfer of radiation through the atmosphere are the single scattering albedo, œâ = œÉ /œÉ ,\n0 sca ext\nwhich ranges between 1 for a non-absorbing medium and 0 for a medium that absorbs and\ndoes not scatter energy, the optical depth, Œ¥, and the Phase function, P(¬µ, ¬µ‚Ä≤), which describes\nthe direction of the scattered energy.\nTo gain insight on the issue of detecting clouds using IR observations from satellites, it is\nuseful to first consider the two-stream solution . Using the discrete-ordinates approach (Liou\n1973; Stamnes and Swanson 1981), the solution for the upward radiance from the top of a\nuniform single cloud layer is:\nI = M L exp(‚ÄìkŒ¥) + M L + B(T), (2)\nobs ‚Äì ‚Äì + + c\nwhere\nI‚Üì is the downward radiance (assumed isotropic) incident on the top of the cloud layer, I‚Üë the\nupward radiance at the base of the layer, and g the asymmetry parameter. Tc is a\nrepresentative temperature of the cloud layer.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 18\nCloud Mask\nA challenge in cloud masking is detecting thin clouds. Assuming a thin cloud layer, the\neffective transmittance (ratio of the radiance exiting the layer to that incident on the base) is\nderived from equation (2) by expanding the exponential. The effective transmittance is a\nfunction of the ratio of I‚Üì/I‚Üë and B(Tc)/I‚Üë. Using atmospheric window regions for cloud\ndetection minimizes the I‚Üì/I‚Üë term and maximizes the B(Tc)/I‚Üë term. Figure 3 is a simulation\nof differences in brightness temperature between clear and cloudy sky conditions using the\nsimplified set of equations . In these simulations, there is no atmosphere, the surface is\nemitting at a blackbody temperature of 290 K, the cloud particles are ice spheres with a\ngamma size distribution assuming an effective radius of 10 Œºm, and the cloud optical depth Œ¥\n= 0.1. Two cloud temperatures are simulated (210 K and 250 K). Brightness temperature\ndifferences between the clear and cloudy sky are caused by non-linearity of the Planck\nfunction and spectral variation in the single scattering properties of the cloud. This figure\ndoes not include the absorption and emission of atmospheric gases, which would also\ncontribute to brightness temperature differences. Observations of brightness temperature\ndifferences at two or more wavelengths can help separate the atmospheric signal from the\ncloud effect.\nFigure 3: A simple simulation of the brightness temperature differences between a ‚Äúclear‚Äù\nand cloudy sky as a function of wavelength. The underlying temperature is 290 K and the\ncloud optical depth is 0.1. All computations assume ice spheres with re = 10 ¬µm.\n2.4.1.3 Methodology\nThe basis of our methodology is, first to generate a clear composite of the maximum\nbrightness temperature in thermal channels to get rough idea about the surface temperature in\nthe clear sky condition at a particular time. Here assumption is that any pixel in the image\nwill not be covered by cloud continuously at a particular time for several (user defined no.)\ndays and the maximum brightness temperature will represent the clear sky background\ntemperature of that location. This will be the reference background temperature on which the\nthreshold for a particular location will be determined to discriminate cloud.\nFirst step : Generation of BT\nmax\nBT = max (BT of each time of previous several (user defined no.) days)\nmax 11\nDefault number of days for clear composite image is 20.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 19\nCloud Mask\nSIMPLE BT THRESHOLD TEST\nSeveral infrared window threshold and temperature difference techniques have been\ndeveloped. These algorithms are most effective for cold clouds over water and must be used\nwith caution in other situations. The first infrared test to apply is a simple threshold test.\nWhen the brightness temperature in the 11 Œºm (BT ) channel is less by some threshold\n11\nvalue than the maximum BT at that location, we assume the pixel to fail the clear-sky\ncondition, because the change in BT will not be more than these due to change in other\natmospheric condition.This was determined by some radiative transfer simulation for\ndifferent atmospheric condition. This test gives a first set of cloudy pixels in the image.\nSecond step : First set of cloudy pixels\nOver land :\nIf (BT ‚Äì BT ) > 12 K , then Cloudflag =1 ( Cloudy pixels)\nmax 11\nOver ocean :\nIf (BT ‚Äì BT ) > 6 K , then Cloudflag =1 ( Cloudy pixels)\nmax 11\nThird step : First set of clear pixels.\nIf abs(BT ‚Äì BT ) < 2 K, then Cloudflag = 0 (Clear sky pixel)\nmax 11\nFor rest of the points Cloudflag = 9 ( For further test )\nFor points with Cloudflag = 9 ,\nSOLAR ZENITH ANGLE CALCULATION\nSolar zenith angle has to be calculated for determining the day / night condition of the pixel.\nSolar zenith angle (ÔÅ±) :\ns\nÔÅ± (in radian) = ÔÅ∞/2 ‚Äì ASIN((SINÔÅ§ SIN(latitude)) + COSÔÅ§ COS(latitude) COSH) (1)\ns\nÔÅ§ (in radian) = solar declination angle = 0.39785SIN(4.869 + 0.0172cday +\n0.03345SIN(6.224+0.0172cday)) (2)\nH = sun hour angle at time ,‚Äòt‚Äô (in IST hrs.), in a calender day (cday)\nIF (t GT 12) AND (longitude GT 82.5) THEN\nH = t1 + L (3)\nOtherwise,\nIF ((t LT 12) AND (longitude LT 82.5)) THEN\nH = t1 + L (4)\nOtherwise,\nH = t1 ‚Äì L (5)\nWhere,\nL = ABS(longitude ‚Äì 82.5) (6)\nt1 = 15(ABS(12-t)) (7)\nIf the solar zenith angle > 86.5 ¬∫\nThen pixel is considered to be falling in the night time.\nelse\nPixel is in the day time.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 20\nCloud Mask\nBT - BT TEST (For points with Cloudflag = 9 )\n11 3.9\nChannel (3.9 Œºm) measures radiances in the window region near 3.8-4 Œºm so that the\ndifference between BT11 and BT3.9 can be used to detect the presence of clouds. At night the\ndifference between the brightness temperatures measured in the shortwave (3.9 Œºm) and in\nthe longwave (11 Œºm) window regions (BT11 ‚Äì BT3.9) can be used to detect partial cloud or\nthin cloud within the INSAT field of view. Small or negative differences are observed only\nfor the case where an opaque scene (such as thick cloud or the surface) fills the field of view\nof the sensor. Negative differences occur at night over extended clouds due to the lower\ncloud emissivity at 3.9 Œºm.\nDuring the daylight hours the difference between BT11 and BT3.9 is large and negative\nbecause of reflection of solar energy at 3.9 Œºm. This technique is very successful at detecting\nlow-level water clouds.\nModerate to large differences between BT11 and BT3.9 result when a nonuniform scene (e.g.,\nbroken cloud) is observed. The different spectral response to a scene of non-uniform\ntemperature is a result of Planck‚Äôs law. The brightness temperature dependence on the\nwarmer portion of the scene increasing with decreasing wavelength (the shortwave window\nPlanck radiance is proportional to temperature to the thirteenth power, while the longwave\ndependence is to the fourth power). Differences in the brightness temperatures of the\nlongwave and shortwave channels are small when viewing mostly clear or mostly cloudy\nscenes; however, for intermediate situations the differences become large (greater than 3¬∞C).\nTable 2 lists examples of the thresholds as used in MODIS algorithm. We have used similar\nthresholds as used in MODIS algorithm.\nThe application of BT11 ‚Äì BT3.9 is difficult in deserts during daytime. Bright desert\nregions with highly variable emissivities tend to be incorrectly classified as cloudy with this\ntest. The problem is mitigated somewhat in the cloud mask by making use of a double-sided\ntest where brightness temperature differences greater than a \"low\" threshold but less than a\n\"high\" threshold are labeled clear while values outside this range are called cloudy. The\nthresholds are listed in Table 2. This threshold strategy along with the use of clear-sky\nrestoral tests is effective for detecting low-level clouds over deserts. We are leaving these\nregions as undetermined if it is failing other tests.\nDetecting clouds at high latitudes using infrared window is a challenging problem due to the\ncold surface temperatures. Yamanouchi et al. (1987) describe a nighttime polar (Antarctic)\ncloud/surface discrimination algorithm based upon brightness temperature differences\nbetween the AVHRR 3.7 and 11 Œºm channels and between the 11 and 12 Œºm channels. We\nare not attempting at those regions because data at such large angle of view is not very useful\nand not used for any parameter retrieval.\nTable 2: Thresholds used for BT11 ‚Äì BT3.9 test for low clouds are same as in the MODIS\ncloud mask algorithm.\n.Scene Type Threshold High confidence clear Low confidence\nclear\nDay ocean -8 .0 K -6.0 K -1 0.0 K\nNight ocean 0.0 K -1.0 K 1.0 K\nDay land -12.0 K -10.0 K -14. 0 K\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 21\nCloud Mask\nBT3.7 - BT12 TEST\nThis window brightness temperature difference test is applied during the nighttime over some,\nbut not all, surfaces. This difference is useful for separating thin cirrus and cloud free\ncondition and is relatively insensitive to the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere\n(Hutchison and Hardy 1995). This test is executed over land at night. The three thresholds for\nMODIS algorithm are 15, 10, and 5 K, for low confidence, mid-point, and high confidence,\nrespectively. Over snow-covered surfaces, the thresholds are 4.50, 4.00, and 3.50K. We shall\nbe using only the high confidence thresholds.\nNIGHT OCEAN SPATIAL VARIABILITY TEST\nThe standard deviation of 3x3 arrays of 11 Œºm brightness temperatures centered on the pixels\nof interest is calculated for ocean scenes at night. The clear-sky ocean surface is usually very\nuniform over regions of this size and, in general, the presence of clouds increases the\nvariability. The thresholds for MODIS algorithm are 0.2K, 0.1K, and 0.05K for low, mid-\npoint, and high confidences, respectively. The reader will note that these values are very\nrestrictive, yet some very uniform low clouds are not detected by this test. For INSAT, we\nare using threshold of 0.05 K.\nIf the Standard deviation ÔÅ≥ in 3 x 3 array of BT is less 0.05 then the pixel is a clear sky\n11\npixel.\nIf ÔÅ≥ < 0.05 then cloudflag = 0 for the center pixel.\nSPATIAL UNIFORMITY TEST\nThe previous test is applied only over the ocean.

Besides the broadband instruments that are dedicated for observing the OLR, for\nexample, Cloud and Earth‚Äôs Radiant Energy System (CERES), there are many algorithms\nthat estimate OLR by converting the narrowband radiances into broadband flux (OLR;\nEllingson et al. 1989, Ellingson et al. 1994, Singh et al., 2007, Sun et al., 2010). Algorithm\nto estimate the OLR from the Geostationary Indian National Satellite (INSAT-3D) imager\nobserved WV (6.5 ‚Äì 7.1 ¬µm) and thermal infrared (TIR-1; 10.3 ‚Äì 11.3 ¬µm and TIR-2; 11.5 ‚Äì\n12.5 ¬µm) radiances has been developed in the frame of the IMDPS. The developed algorithm\nwill be used operationally when data from the INSAT-3D satellite will be available.\nAlgorithm to estimate the OLR is developed using two basic approaches:\ni. In the first approach, a large database of spectral radiance fields and broadband flux\n(OLR) built using Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Model (RTM) is used to develop\nthe algorithm. The radiative transfer computations are performed at 19400\nwavelengths covering the thermal region (4‚Äì100 ÔÅ≠m) and for 4704 realistic\nconditions of the Earth‚Äìatmosphere system.\nii. In the second approach, INSAT-3D imager radiances collocated (in space and time)\nwith CERES OLR available from Terra and Aqua satellites, are used to develop the\nalgorithm.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 30\nOutgoing longwave radiation\n3.2.1 Overview and background\nThe earth and its atmosphere absorb the shortwave (SW) radiation coming from the sun and\nemit thermal longwave (LW) radiation to space. These two radiation streams can be\nrepresented approximately by blackbody radiation of 6000K for the solar SW and 290K for\nthe terrestrial (LW). The balance between the incoming SW radiation and the LW determines\nthe temperature in the atmosphere and on the earth‚Äôs surface. Outgoing longwave radiation\n(OLR) is the emission to space of terrestrial radiation (LW) from the top of the earth's\natmosphere. OLR is strongly controlled by three main meteorological variables, namely the\ntemperature of the earth and the atmosphere above it, the presence of water vapor in the\natmosphere (which strongly absorbs infra-red radiation attenuating the terrestrial signal) and\nthe presence of clouds (which may completely block all outgoing infra-red radiation from the\nsurface). Thus, OLR reveal information on the temperature, humidity and cloudiness of the\natmosphere. Allan et al. (1999) state that changes in humidity in the mid-troposphere (400 to\n700 hPa) are most important in explaining clear-sky OLR variations.\nThe estimates of outgoing longwave radiation, both operational and experimental\nhave been particularly useful for variety of problems in climate sensitivity and diagnostics\n(e.g., Schmetz and Liu, 1988), numerical weather forecasting and climate models. The OLR\nhas been used traditionally for radiation budget studies of the earth-atmosphere system. The\ntop of the atmosphere radiative energy balance between net incoming solar radiation and\nOLR is crucial in determining the large-scale atmospheric circulation and, therefore, the\nsynoptic evolution that is important for weather and climate prediction. OLR is a major\ncomponent of the Earth‚Äôs Radiation Budget, which drives the atmospheric circulation,\nparticularly over the tropics. This is mainly due to the fact that in the tropics, the OLR is\nlargely modulated by cloudiness. In particular, it varies with cloud top temperature and\nconsequently, low radiation values indicate the major convective system. Generally, values\nless than 250 Wm-2 would give a good indication of the cloudiness over the tropics.\nThe observations of OLR by earth orbiting satellites have been made from the\nbeginning of the environmental satellite program. Besides the broadband instruments that are\ndedicated for observing the OLR, for example, Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE),\nScanner Radiometer for Radiation Budget (ScaRab), and Cloud and Earth‚Äôs Radiant Energy\nSystem (CERES), there are many algorithms that estimate OLR by converting the\nnarrowband radiance observations into broadband flux (4‚Äì100 ¬µm). The OLR was routinely\nobtained from the 10‚Äì12 ¬µm window on operational National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration (NOAA) polar-orbiting satellite beginning in 1974 (Gruber and Winston,\n1978). Early operational estimation of OLR employed a simple parameterization using the\nwindow channel brightness temperature of the advanced very high resolution radiometer\n(AVHRR) on NOAA 6‚Äì7 (Ellingson and Ferraro, 1983; Gruber and Krueger, 1984). New\nalgorithms were developed in subsequent years to improve the accuracy of the OLR.\nEllingson et al. (1989) have shown that the linear combination of only four (6.6‚Äì 6.9 ¬µm;\n7.9‚Äì8.5 ¬µm; 13.1‚Äì13.6 ¬µm; 14.3‚Äì14.7 ¬µm) High Resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS)\nchannels could account for more than 99% of the OLR total variance. Comparison with the\nERBE (Ellingson et al., 1994) instrument flown in NOAA 9‚Äì11 satellites suggested that\nestimates made with HIRS data exhibited errors of the same order as the estimated accuracy\nof ERBE (5 Wm-2), where as use of AVHRR data exhibits monthly bias of -1 to +2 Wm-2\nand rms differences of about 14 Wm-2 (Gruber et al., 1994).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 31\nOutgoing longwave radiation\nGeostationary satellite observations have also been used for OLR estimation. Schmetz and\nLiu (1988) and Cheruy et al. (1991) developed OLR retrieval technique using two channels\n(infrared window and water vapor) of Meteosat. Minnis et al. (1991) developed an algorithm\nto estimate OLR using Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) imager\nwindow channels with additional water vapor information from analysis. Ba and Ellingson\n(2001) estimated OLR using several channels of the GOES sounder and presented\ncomparisons with the CERES measurements. Ba et al. (2003) adapted the HIRS technique to\nGOES sounder and validated the derived OLR with collocated OLR measured from CERES\nonboard Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Terra satellites. Their results\nshow instantaneous agreement within about 7 Wm-2. Singh et al. (2007) estimated OLR using\nthe infrared window and water vapor channels radiances from Kalpana.\nObjective\nTo develop the algorithm for estimating OLR from narrow band radiances from WV (6.5 ‚Äì\n7.1 ¬µm), TIR-1 (10.3 ‚Äì 11.3 ¬µm) and TIR-2 (11.5 ‚Äì 12.5 ¬µm) channels of INSAT-3D imager.\nAlgorithm is developed using two basic approaches:\ni.

Since narrow field-of-view (NFOV) radiometers\non-board satellites, such as CERES, measure the upwelling radiance only in specific\noutgoing directions from a scene on Earth at any given time, OLR cannot be measured\ninstantaneously. Given a radiance field, L(Œ∏, Œ¶) , at the TOA, where Œ∏ is the satellite viewing\nzenith angle, and Œ¶ the azimuth angle, the OLR leaving the earth-atmosphere system, is\nobtained by integrating the radiance field over the solid angle œâ of the upper hemisphere:\nÔÅ∞\n2ÔÅ∞\nOLR ÔÄΩ ÔÉ≤2ÔÉ≤ L(ÔÅ±,ÔÅ¶)cosÔÅ±sinÔÅ±dÔÅ±dÔÅ¶ (1)\n0 0\nÔÅ¨ÔÄΩ100ÔÅ≠m\nL(ÔÅ±,ÔÅ¶)ÔÄΩ ÔÉ≤ L (ÔÅ±,ÔÅ¶)dÔÅ¨ (2)\nÔÅ¨\nÔÅ¨ÔÄΩ4ÔÅ≠m\nFor an isotropic radiance field, the radiance to OLR conversion is simple (OLR=œÄL).\nUnfortunately, the radiance field L(Œ∏, Œ¶) is not isotropic and an accurate portraying of the\nanisotropy is needed to estimate the OLR from the radiance measurement. The anisotropic\nemission factor (AEF) R(Œ∏, Œ¶ ) is defined as the ratio of the equivalent Lambertian OLR to\nthe actual OLR (Loeb et al., 2003).\nÔÅ∞L(ÔÅ±,ÔÅ¶)\nR(ÔÅ±,ÔÅ¶)ÔÄΩ (3)\nOLR\nEq.

However, if the observations at entire (e.g\n4 ¬µm ‚Äì 100 ¬µm) spectral range are not available, a mapping function of the following form\nshould be determined to retrieve OLR from the available, narrow band radiances:\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 33\nOutgoing longwave radiation\nOLR ÔÄΩF(ÔÅ±,N (ÔÅ±)) (4)\ni\nWhere ÔÅ± satellite zenith angle and N is the observed narrow band radiances in ith channel.\ni\nThe radiance in a particular channel is related to the specific intensity I at wavelength Œª and\nthe instrument responsively Œ∑ as\nN (ÔÅ±) ÔÄΩ ÔÉ≤ I(ÔÅ¨,ÔÅ±)ÔÅ® (ÔÅ¨)dÔÅ¨\n(5)\ni i\nÔÅÑÔÅ¨i\n3.4.1.1 Radiative Transfer Model\nSanta Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model developed by\nRicchiazzi et al (1998) at University of California is used for INSAT-3D imager radiance\nsimulations. SBDART is designed for the analysis of a wide variety of radiative transfer\nproblems encountered in satellite remote sensing and atmospheric energy budget studies.\nSBDART is based on a collection of highly developed and reliable physical models\ndeveloped by the atmospheric science community. A brief description to the key components\nof the model is discussed below:\nCloud Model: Clouds are a major modulator of the earth‚Äôs climate by reflecting visible\nradiation and intercepting part of the infrared radiation emitted by the Earth and re-radiating\nit back to the surface. The computation of radiative transfer within a cloudy atmosphere\nrequires knowledge of the scattering efficiency, the single scattering albedo, and the\nasymmetry factor, which indicates the strength of forward scattering. SBDART contains an\ninternal database of these parameters for clouds computed with a Mie scattering code and\ncovers a range of particle size effective radius in the range 2 to 128 ¬µm. By default, the\nangular distribution of scattered photons is based on the simple Henyey-Greenstein\nparameterization, but more detailed scattering functions may be input as desired.\nGas Absorption Model: Standard SBDART uses low-resolution band models developed for\nthe LOWTRAN 7 atmospheric transmission code (Pierluissi and Marogoudakis, 1986).\nThese models provide the clear sky atmospheric transmission from 0 to 50000 cm-1 and\ninclude the effects of all radiatively active molecular species found in the earth's atmosphere.\nThe models were derived from detailed line-by-line calculations, which were degraded to 20\ncm-1 resolution for use in LOWTRAN. This translates to a wavelength resolution of about\n0.005 ¬µm in the visible and about 0.2 ¬µm in the thermal infrared. A capability to read high-\nresolution k-distribution optical depths from a disk file is introduced in SBDART version 2.0\nwhich is less convenient to use than the standard approach. However, it has the advantage of\nremoving limitations in the ultimate spectral resolution available with SBDART.\nExtraterrestrial Source Spectra: SBDART has options for three extraterrestrial solar\nspectrum models: LOWTRAN-7 solar spectrum (Shettle and Fenn, 1975), solar models used\nin 5s or MODTRAN-3 solar spectrum.\nStandard Atmospheric Models: SBDART has six standard atmospheric profiles from the\n5s atmospheric radiation code to model the following typical climatic conditions: tropical,\nmid-latitude summer, mid-latitude winter, subarctic summer, subarctic winter and US62.\nThese model atmospheres (McClatchey et al, 1971) have been widely used in the\natmospheric research community and provide standard vertical profiles of pressure,\ntemperature, water vapor and ozone density. Optionally users can specify their own model\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 34\nOutgoing longwave radiation\natmosphere, e.g, a radiosonde profile. The concentration of trace gases such as CO or CH\n2 4\nare assumed to make up a fixed fraction (which may be specified by the user) of the total\nparticle density.\nStandard Aerosol Models: SBDART can compute the radiative effects of several common\nboundary layer and upper atmosphere aerosol types. In the boundary layer, the user can select\nfrom rural, urban, or maritime aerosols. The total vertical optical depth of boundary layer\naerosols is derived from user specified horizontal meteorological visibility at 0.55 ¬µm and an\ninternal vertical distribution model. In the upper atmosphere up to 5 aerosol layers can be\nspecified, with radiative characteristics that model fresh and aged volcanic, meteoric and the\nclimatological tropospheric background aerosols. The aerosol models included in SBDART\nwere derived from those provided in the 5s and LOWTRAN7.\nRadiative Transfer Equation Solver: The radiative transfer equation is numerically\nintegrated with DISORT (DIScreet Ordinate Radiative Transfer, Stamnes et al, 1988). The\ndiscrete ordinate method provides a numerically stable algorithm to solve the equations of\nplane-parallel radiative transfer in a vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere. The intensity of\nboth scattered and thermally emitted radiation can be computed at different heights and\ndirections. SBDART is configured to allow up to 65 atmospheric layers and 40 radiation\nstreams (40 zenith angles and 40 azimuthal modes).\nSurface Models: The ground surface cover is an important determinant of the overall\nradiation environment. In SBDART six basic surface types -- ocean water, lake water,\nvegetation, snow and sand are used to parameterize the spectral reflectivity of the surface.\nThe spectral reflectivity of a large variety of surface conditions is well approximated by\ncombinations of these basic types. For example, the fractions of vegetation, water and sand\ncan be adjusted to generate a new spectral reflectivity representing new/old growth, or\ndeciduous vs. evergreen forest. Combining a small fraction of the spectral reflectivity of\nwater with that of sand yields an overall spectral dependence close to wet soil.\n3.4.1.2 RTM simulated OLR and INSAT-3D radiances\nTo develop the empirical relationship between narrow band radiances and OLR a large\ndatabase of spectral radiance fields was built using SBDART model. The radiative transfer\ncomputations were performed at 19400 wavelengths covering the thermal region 4‚Äì100 ÔÅ≠m\nfor 4704 realistic conditions of the Earth‚Äìatmosphere system. For each element in the\ndatabase, the main inputs for the radiative transfer computations were: the atmospheric\nprofiles of temperature, pressure, water vapor, and ozone concentrations. These profiles are\nextracted from the TIGR-3 database, which is a representative set of 2311 profiles selected\namong a larger set of worldwide soundings. Additional 41 diverse profiles of temperature,\nwater vapor and ozone from ECMWF were also taken. The surface temperature is set close to\nthe temperature at the level close to surface in the profile. The cloud cover is generated\nrandomly. The cloud cover may contain up to three overlapping layers, each characterized by\na random height, optical thickness, phase (water or ice), and drop size distribution. Half of\nthe database (2352 elements) corresponds to cloud-free conditions and the other half\ncorresponds to the same conditions but with the addition of cloud cover. For each element in\nthe database, the OLR and the spectral radiance field L (ÔÅ±={0¬∫, 5¬∫, . . . 65¬∫}) are computed.\nFilter response function for the INSAT-3D imager WV and thermal channel (TIR-1 and TIR-\n2) were provided as input to the SBDART. Radiances were simulated for each set of profile\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 35\nOutgoing longwave radiation\nand zenith angle at the top of atmosphere (70 km) from SBDART for WV, TIR-1 and TIR-2\nchannels.\n3.4.1.3 Conversion of Narrow Band Radiances to Broad Band Flux (OLR)\nALG-1 is developed using RTM simulated OLR and INSAT-3D radiances. While ALG-2 is\ndeveloped using the INSAT-3D radiances and collocated (in space and time) CERES\nmeasured OLR. In practice, development of ALG-2 is possible only after the launch of\nINSAT-3D. However, to develop the preliminary version, we have used Visible Infrared\nSpin Scan Radiometer (VISSR) onboard FY-2D (positioned at 86.5¬∫ E) radiances to generate\nproxy radiances for INSAT-3D. This is due to the fact that INSAT-3D channels (TIR-1, TIR-\n2 and WV), which will be used for the development of OLR algorithm, are very similar to\nthose of FY-2D channels. INSAT-3D radiances are generated using VISSR measured\nradiances by accounting the difference in the radiances due to the SRF differences of FY-2D\nand INSAT-3D channels. We have also developed the algorithm to estimate the OLR using\nFY-2D measured radiances.\nThe FY-2D radiance data from 1-15 July and 1-15 December, 2011 over the FY-2D\nfull disk domain were collocated with CERES SSF data from all four instruments (FM1,\nFM2, FM3 and FM4) onboard Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively. The FY-2D radiance\nobservations were averaged for 4x4 pixels (native resolution is 5 km at the sub-satellite\npoint) to match the CERES resolution (about 20 km nadir). The criterion for the FY-2D and\nCERES collocations is taken as time coincidence within ¬± 5 minutes and a distance window\nof 5 km radius between the FY-2D and the CERES observations. These collocated\nnarrowband radiances, satellite zenith angle and OLR are then used to find the empirical\nrelationship between the OLR, satellite zenith angle and narrowband radiances (Channels;\nIR1, IR2 and IR3 of FY-2D). Using a radiative transfer simulation, we found empirical\nrelationship between INSAT-3D and FY-2D radiances. The developed empirical relationship\nwas then applied on FY-2D measured radiances to obtain the INSAT-3D radiances. These\nFY-2D measured radiances and the INSAT-3D simulated radiances using FY-2D measured\nradiances and collocated CERES OLR were used to develop the OLR algorithm (under\nsecond approach: ALG-2).\nIn both approaches (ALG-1 and ALG-2), genetic algorithm (GA) is used to determine\nthe optimum relationship between broadband flux (OLR) and spectral radiances of WV and\nthermal infrared channels. A unique advantage of GA is that complex (often nonlinear)\nrelationships between different variables can be obtained in the form of simple and usable\nequations. In the case of other nonlinear methods like ANN, the task of using the algorithm\noften requires a complete understanding of the neural network, which includes a complex\narray of input layers, hidden layers, the shape of the response function at each layer, and the\nweights connecting these layers. A major difference between other nonlinear techniques (like\nANN) and GA is that the algorithm development under GA is almost completely objective\nand data adaptive.\nThe development of the OLR retrieval algorithm involves a number of steps. In the\nfirst step, the collocated data of narrowband radiances (both FY-2D and INSAT-3D), satellite\nzenith angle and OLR were divided into two unequal random samples. Sample I is used to\ntrain the GA and Sample II is used for evaluation of the algorithm. Genetic algorithm (GA)\nwas then applied to find optimal relationship between narrow band radiances and OLR for\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 36\nOutgoing longwave radiation\ntraining data (Sample I). The GA training provides empirical equations (INSAT-3D as well\nas FY-2D) relating OLR to narrowband radiances and satellite zenith angle. The root mean\nsquare error (rmse) on the training data is about 7 Wm-2. The developed algorithm was\napplied on the Sample-II data in order to compute the OLR. The computed OLR for Sample-\nII data was compared with observed OLR and the root mean square error (rmse) was\ncomputed. The root mean square error (rmse) is about 9 Wm-2 (about 3 %) for both FY-2D\nand INSAT-3D.\n3.4.1.4 Genetic algorithm\nModeling natural phenomena has been a standard practice in atmospheric sciences.\nTraditionally, modeling a physical system requires one to derive the relevant equations from\nfirst principles taking into account the physical laws that determine the system under\nconsideration. Alternatively, when such an approach is not feasible due to some reasons, e.g.,\nthe perfect physics of the system is not well understood, or the required computing resources\nare not available, empirical laws governing the physical processes can be obtained by model-\nfitting approaches based on the observed variability of the system and its relationship with\nother parameters. Let us assume that there exists a smooth mapping function P(.) that\nexplains the relationship between a predicted variable x and a set of dependent variables\n[a,b,c,d,e,‚Ä¶], so that\nx = P [a,b,c,d,e, ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..] (6)\nIn various areas of geophysics, it is a standard practice to employ linear or\nnonlinear regression techniques in order to obtain the form of P(.). However, the choice of a\nregression model is quite subjective, and it is difficult to ensure that a particular regression\nmodel provides the best possible explanation to the variance in a data set. This has inspired\nthe researchers to look for more objective data fitting approaches like genetic algorithm\n(GA). A genetic algorithm is programmed to approximate the equation, in symbolic form,\nthat best describes the relationship between independent and dependent parameters. The\ngenetic algorithm considers an initial population of potential solutions, which is subjected to\nan evolutionary process, by selecting those equations (individuals) that best fit the data. The\nstrongest strings (made up from a combination of variables, real numbers, and arithmetic\noperators) of choose a mate for reproduction whereas the weaker strings become extinct. The\nnewly generated population is subjected to mutations that change fractions of information.\nThe evolutionary steps are repeated with the new generation. The process ends after a\nnumber of generations a priori determined by the user. The procedural details of genetic\nalgorithm can be found in Szpiro (1997), Alvarez et al., (2000) and Singh et al (2006). A\nbrief description of genetic algorithm is as follows.\nFirst, for a desired function x (e.g. in Eq.-6), a set of candidate equations for P(.) is\nrandomly generated. An equation is stored in the computer as a set of characters that define\nthe independent variables, a, b,c,d,e.. etc. in Eq. (6), and four elementary arithmetic operators\n(+,-,x, and /). A criterion that measures how well the equation strings perform on a training\nset of the data is its fitness to the data, defined as sum of the squared differences between\ndata and independent parameter derived from the equation string. The strongest individuals\n(equations with best fits) are then selected to exchange parts of the character strings between\nthem (reproduction and crossover) while individuals less fitted to the data are discarded.\nFinally, a small percentage of the equation strings‚Äô most basic elements, single operators and\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 37\nOutgoing longwave radiation\nvariables, are mutated at random. The process is repeated a large number of times to improve\nthe fitness of the evolving population of equations. The fitness strength of the best scoring\nequation is defined as:\nR2 = 1 ‚Äì [ÔÅÑ2 / ÔÉ• (x - <x > )2] (7)\no o\nwhere ÔÅÑ2 = ÔÉ• (x ‚Äì x )2, x is parameter value estimated by the best scoring equation, x is\nc o c o\nthe corresponding ‚Äútrue‚Äù value, <x > is the mean of the ‚Äútrue‚Äù values of x. Szpiro (1997) has\no\nshown the robustness of the genetic algorithm to forecast the behavior of one-dimensional\nchaotic dynamical system.\n3.4.1.5 Flow Chart\nINSAT-3D imager\nWV, TIR-1 and TIR-2 radiances\nCalculate zenith angle\nGeolocation file OLR retrieval OLR coefficients\nOLR\n3.4.2 Operational Implementation\n3.4.2.1 Step 1 : Computation of the narrow band radiances from gray values\n3.4.2.2 Step 2 : Computation of OLR from narrow band radiances\n3.4.2.3 Step 3 : Merging of OLR with Geolocation files\n3.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nOLR Wm-2 50 400 3 % pixel\n3.5.1 Format of the output and the domain\nLat, Lon, OLR,\nDomain: 50 S to 50 N, 35 E to 135 E\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 38\nOutgoing longwave radiation\n3.6 Validation\n3.6.1 Data required\nThe OLR computed by the developed algorithms will be compared with observed OLR.

Varma\n4.2 INTRODUCTION\nWeather and climate affects many sectors of the human activity as well as many\naspects of the world's natural ecosystems. The hydrological cycle is one of the important\ncomponents of Weather and climate system. The hydrological cycle describes the exchange\nof water substance between sea, air, soil, rock, plants and animals. The precipitation and\nevaporation processes significantly affect the global hydrological cycle. The quantitative\nassessment of precipitation is needed to improve understanding of the behavior of global\nenergy and circulation patterns as well as the nature of climate variability. The choice of\nmeasured parameter has been influenced by the cost of installation, operation, longevity and\ntemporal as well as spatial coverage of the instruments. The land based techniques of rainfall\nestimation are not sufficient for global rainfall assessment as about 70% of the Earth is\ncovered with water. The space borne measurement and monitoring of rainfall is, therefore, a\ntopic of major interest since they provide global coverage both on land and ocean for an\nextended period of time. A longstanding promise of meteorological satellites is the improved\nidentification and quantification of precipitation at time scales consistent with the nature and\ndevelopment of precipitation processes. Meteorological satellites expand the coverage and\ntime span of conventional ground-based rainfall data for a number of applications. The\nprimary scope of satellite rainfall monitoring is to provide information on rainfall occurrence,\namount and distribution over the regional to continental scales. The uneven distribution of\nrain gauges and weather radars and the relative lack of rainfall measurements over the oceans\nhave significantly limited the use of global as well local data. Precipitation is one of the most\nvariable quantities in space and time. Precipitation also has a direct impact on human life that\nother atmospheric phenomena seldom have: an example is represented by heavy rain events\nand flash floods (Barrett and Michell, 1991). Geostationary weather satellite visible (VIS)\nand infrared (IR) imagers provide the rapid temporal update cycle needed to capture the\ngrowth and decay of precipitating clouds. Microwaves provide the interaction of radiation\nwith hydrometeors but with coarser resolution and limited swath widths of satellites with in\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 44\nSea surface temperature\ntropical orbit such as the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) (Kummerow et al.,\n1998) and of sensors in polar orbits like the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) series.\n4.2.1 Overview\nOperational applications, require quantitative rainfall determination from a variety of\nprecipitating systems, which differ both dynamically and microphysically. This fact prompts\nfor non-unique solutions based on the physics of precipitation formation processes. Barrett\nand Martin (1981) and Kidder and Vonder Haar (1995) give excellent reviews of the\navailable methods. Petty (1995) has examined the status of satellite rainfall estimation over\nland. Recent reviews Levizzani et al. (2001) has covered results and future perspectives from\nthe geostationary orbit. The perspective varies widely from the relatively simple methods\nused for climatic-scale analyses (e.g. Arkin and Ardanuy, 1989; Arkin and Janowiak, 1991)\nto the more elaborate instantaneous rainrate estimations for research and nowcasting (Ba and\nGruber, 2001; Turk et al., 2000; Vicente et al., 1998).\nRecent technological developments of MW instruments on board polar orbiters have\nbeen dramatic but the use of VIS, IR and water vapor (WV) channels of geostationary\nsatellites is still indispensable. In particular, the launch of the newest generation of\ngeostationary satellites, the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES-I-M\nseries (Menzel and Purdom,1994) and the upcoming METEOSAT Second Generation\n(MSG) (Schmetz et al., 2002) with its Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager\n(SEVIRI), adds new channels to the traditional VIS/IR/WV triplet. Some of the new channels\nhave been tested for decades as part of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer\n(AVHRR) series on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)\npolar orbiters or have other heritages.\nMultispectral data have long since been available both from polar orbiting and\ngeostationary satellite sensors and used for retrieving cloud properties. The relevant channels\nfor cloud characterization were part of the payload of the polar satellites, while the sensors at\ngeosynchronous altitude were almost exclusively devoted to VIS-IR operational monitoring\nof precipitation system displacements. This has considerably changed in the past few years\nsince more and more sophisticated sensors have been conceived for the GEO orbits that will\nallow for global real-time cloud characterization.\nCloud radiative properties at VIS, near IR (NIR) and IR wavelengths have long since\nbeen studied and documented (among others Arking and Childs, 1985; Cheng et al., 1993,\nSaunders and Kriebel, 1988; Slingo and Schrecker, 1982). In the thermal IR the radiative\nproperties are sensitive to the size distribution of the hydrometeors. In particular, an increase\nin the particle size increases the transmissivity, decreasing the reflectivity and increasing the\nemissivity of the cloud layer. This latter dominates at these wavelengths. In the NIR (e.g. the\n3.9 mm MSG channel) the emissivity of a cloud layer is lower than in the thermal IR\nwindow: there is a large contribution of reflected radiation at the cloud top. Clouds with\nsmall hydrometeors scatter and reflect much of the 3.9 mm radiance. An increase in cloud\nparticle size or the presence of large drops or ice crystals near the cloud top reduces the 3.9\nmm reflectance from the cloud. containing more ice reflect less solar radiation in the 3.7 - 3.9\nmm range as ice strongly absorbs at these wavelengths and ice crystals are generally larger\nthan cloud droplets at cloud top. NIR reflectance mostly refers to cloud particles effective\nradius (re).VIS reflectance is primarily due to cloud optical depth.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 45\nSea surface temperature\nSeveral methods have been proposed for the retrieval of cloud parameters from\nvarious cloud types. Pioneering studies were conducted by Arking and Childs (1985) and\nNakajima and King (1990). Water Vapor images show the presence of water in the gas form\nbetween 22,000 and 35,000 feet above the earth's surface. The brighter white color indicates\nareas of moisture. Black depicts neutral. Lensky and Rosenfeld (1997) have conceived a\nmultispectral rainfall estimation technique based on the method of Rosenfeld and Gutman\n(1994). They concentrated on areas of around 2000 km2 that Rosenfeld and Gagin (1989)\nshowed to be the critical limit beyond which a further increase in cloud cluster area does not\nresult in higher rain rates.\nIR and NIR channels other than the thermal IR window show some potential for\napplication to rainfall estimations. Techniques for the instantaneous delineation of convective\nrainfall areas using split window data were initially conceived for the NOAA AVHRR (Inoue,\n1987a,b, 1997) and are instrumental for the detection of semi-transparent cirrus clouds (Inoue,\n1985). These techniques rely upon the detection of non-precipitating cirrus and low-level\ncumulus clouds using the two window channels at 10.5 - 11.5 and 11.5 - 12.5 ¬µm (the so-\ncalled split window). The information content of the split window channels partially corrects\nerroneous rainfall area delineation (and consequent frequent rainfall overestimate) of simple\nIR techniques producing better false alarm ratios (FAR). The NIR 3.9 ¬µm channel of GOES-\n8/9 satellites includes spectral features suitable for applications to rainfall detection and\nestimation. This channel was included for a long time in NOAA/AVHRR instruments\n(centered at 3.7 ¬µm) for a variety of purposes including ice discrimination and sun-glint\ndetection. Vicente (1996) developed a simple and fast algorithm for rainfall retrieval using\nthe 11 and 3.9 ¬µm channels with the obvious advantage of nighttime use and sensitivity to\nthe presence of ice and water vapor.\nIn the present ATBD document the description of the scientific algorithms which will be\ndeveloped and used to estimate rainfall from two of the standard operational algorithms of\nNOAA from the data acquired by the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR ) onboard\nINSAT-3D satellite. VHRR produces images in six spectral channels, in the Visible (VIS),\nNear Infra-red (NIR), Mid Wave Infra-Red (MWIR), and Infra-Red (IR) part of the\nspectrum covering the following channels: VIS 0.6Œºm, NIR 1.6Œºm, MWIR 3.9Œºm, WV\n6.7Œºm, IR 10.8Œºm, IR 12.0Œºm . Each channel of the Imager has different resolution as\nmentioned in the Table-1 in sections ahead.\n4.2.2 Objectives\nThere are two main objectives under the rainfall retrieval algorithms from INSAT-3D.. These\ntechniques are popularly known as GOES Precipitation Index (GPI) and GOES Multispectral\nRainfall Algorithm Technique (GMSRA). Both the algorithms are state of art and aimed at\nestimation of rainfall with different applications at different spatial and temporal\nrequirements respectively. First GPI related objectives are the implementation of the\nalgorithm following Arkin (1979), while the second one is related to the development of the\nalgorithm named GMSRA following Ba and Gruber (2001). Originally the GPI technique has\nbeen in operation for a large scale rainfall estimation by Global community for more than\ntwo decades. The GMSRA on the other hand is a new one and is developed and used only by\nUSA based on integrated efforts from many group of researchers along with the supporting\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 46\nSea surface temperature\ninfrastructure (like ground truths with high spatial and temporal coverage‚Äôs etc.). from a\nhundred of radars on the ground.\nThe inherent limitations of optical channels remains persistent for rainfall retrieval as\nthe rainfall in the ground is inferred by cloud top signatures only. There is no direct physical\nconnection between the rain/cloud and ice hydrometeors within the clouds with radiance\nemanating from cloud tops to the sensor. The accuracy of rainfall estimate is improves only\nmarginally even with significant new efforts. However, the high spatial and temporal\ncoverage of Geostationary optical measurements is the very strong point along with the\nresolution capabilities of the sensors. At the same time microwaves have a direct physical\nconnections with vertical structure of rainfall and thus with the cloud, rain and ice\nhydrometeors. But the non-portability of microwave sensors to the geostationary platforms\ntill date due to technological constraints is a limitation and thus only low earth orbiting\nsatellites can provide the rainfall information of land, ocean and atmosphere as on now. With\nthe advent of active and passive radar and radiometric sensors onboard a single satellite (e.g.\nTropical Rainfall Measuring Mission-TRMM) we envisage that a technique like GMSRA\ncan be further improved for Indian tropical regions and more reliable rainfall information can\nbe retrieved. We henceforth call this technique as INSAT Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm\n(IMSRA), as a specific technique for Indian Tropical regions. Our objectives for both the\ntechniques (GPI and IMSRA) here are based on these premises and are outlined below\n(mainly in cases of IMSRA).\nA1. INSAT-3D Rainfall using GPI Method:\n1. To generate a total day rainfall maps using 3 hourly brightness temperatures of IR (11\num) images for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -500 to +500 lat and 300E to\n1300E using Arkin‚Äôs GPI method.\n2. To generate mean spatial variance and histogram of 24 classes of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0\ndeg latitude/longitude.\n3. To derive QPE based on daily basis following the 3 hourly data of IR observations (8\nimages a day).\n4. Validation of rainfall products using rain gauges and Doppler Weather Radar data.\n5 . Inter-satellite comparison using other contemporary satellites like Meteosat, NOAA etc.\n6. Estimation of rainfall on pentad, monthly mean, seasonal mean and annual mean scales\nafter due calibration/validation from radar and inter-satellite comparisons as above, rainfall.\nA2. To Develop Precipitation Estimates Using the Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm\n(IMSRA) Technique:\nThe relation between precipitation amount and cloud fraction as seen from satellite passive\nradiometers in case of GPI technique above, though simple and straightforward it might seem,\nhas not yet reached completely satisfactory accuracy, effectiveness, and time/space coverage.\nThere are numerous applications in meteorology and hydrology where accurate information\nat scales smaller than the existing 1.0ÔÇ∞ products (e.g. daily or sub daily estimates at\nresolutions of 1ÔÇ∞ and down to the 0.25 0) would be invaluable. There is also increasing\ndemand from the meteorology and climate community for such products over extended\nperiods. High-resolution rainfall information is available for limited areas using\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 47\nSea surface temperature\ncombinations of ground-based radar and dense networks of rain gauges. In India in particular,\nwhere the need of high spatial and temporal rainfall is essential, for large and varied areas of\nIndia (Western Ghats, plateaus, Himalayan Regions, North-Eastern Regions, Arid and Semi-\nArid Zones) however, the in-situ infrastructure necessary for this form of precipitation\nmonitoring network is not in place. Recent developments mostly refer to microwave (MW)\nsensors on board polar orbiters, but the use of visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) sensors of\ngeostationary satellites for a variety of applications is by no means over. Thus a suit of both\nsupplementing each others would be the ideal situation, particularly when the highly\nadvanced microwave sensors data from various international satellites are available on near\nreal time basis.\nThe main objectives here in IMSRA algorithm are to estimate rainfall by developing\na Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm which is an optimal combination of GMSRA and some of\nthe innovative proposed approaches that utilizes microwave remote sensing measurements\nfrom polar orbiting satellites. Here, the rainfall algorithm is with more advantageous that\ncombines satellite passive microwave and infrared (IR) data to account for limitations in both\ndata types. Rainfall estimates are produced at the high spatial resolution and temporal\nfrequency of the IR data using rainfall information from the PMW data. Over the last few\nyears, a number of groups world wide have embarked on development of such techniques\nwherein the advantages of geosynchronous viz. vast coverage and near sufficient space-\ntime sampling, and polar passive microwave radiometers viz. more physically based\nretrievals, are synergistically used to generate tropical rainfall on various scales (e.g.\nAdler et al. 1994, Todd et al. 2001, Gairola and Krishnamurti 1992). With above background\nthe objectives for Multi Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) are as follows.\nThe technique has the following components:\n1. Identify areas for very deep convective cores from IR and WV channels ( 11ÔÅ≠m-\n6.7ÔÅ≠m), which corresponds well with rainfall.\n2. To screen mid-to upper level clouds with or without thin cirrus above the rain and\nnon-rain baring clouds.\n3. Cloud growth classification based on temporal gradients of TIR ‚Äì TB‚Äôs.\n4. Filtering of low and non raining clouds along with the warm and semi-transperent\nclouds based on IR and WV when rainfall is estimated for clouds having brightness\ntemperatures colder than 240K.\n5. Spatial and temporal co-location of INSAT-TIR brightness temperature, and TRMM /\nSSM/I rainfall for creation of matched database.\n6. To compute instantaneous rain rate using pre-calibrated rain rate for cloud top\nbrightness temperature ( 11 ÔÅ≠m) for each pixel classified as containing raining clouds\nalong with Satellite Microwave Radiometric measurements (e.g TRMM Microwave\nImager-TMI).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 48\nSea surface temperature\n7. To adjust the rainfall estimates in association with the product of Integrated\nPrecipitable water and Relative Humidity from 500 mb ‚Äì Surface (from Eta/IMD\nmodel).\n8. Validation of rainfall with Doppler Weather Radar data and fine tunning of\nalgorithm.\n9. Finally to estimate rainfall would be estimated in different spatial and temporal grid\nscales based on all the above components of the IMSRA algorithm.\n4.3 Inputs\n4.3.1 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nThe details for the required satellite data for both GPI and IMSRA are provided in following\ntable:\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit -- Derived from raw data\ngeometric corrected by DP (data\ngray count values of processing)\nTIR-1 channel (10.5)\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data\ngeometric corrected by DP\ngray count values of\nTIR-2 channel (11.5)\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data\ngeometric corrected by DP\ngray count values of\nVIS channel\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data\ngeometric corrected by DP\ngray count values of ,\nWV channel (6.7)\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from raw data\ngeometric corrected by DP\ngray count values of 3.9\nmm\nGray value to - - 0.3 K Derived by DP\nbrightness temperature\nconversion table\nGeolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by DP using\nCalibration Table\n4.3.2 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs\nIn addition to satellite data from INSAT-3D, radar and rain gauge data, and atmospheric\nmoisture products (integrated precipitable water and relative humidity from 500-mb surface)\nobtained from the IMD/Eta Model analysis are essential on required grid spacing in different\ntemporal scales. The gridded rainfall data from Doppler Weather Radars are needed from\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 49\nSea surface temperature\nIMD at every one hourly time interval on 1x1 and 0.25x0.25 deg grid resolution for GPI and\nIMSRA techniques. The rainfall from DWRs should be well calibrated and the products\nshould be well converted to rain rate using an appropriate Z-R relation well tested and\nvalidated over Indian regional sites of the respective radar locations. In some cases one\nhourly rainfall from fast response rain gauges would be highly desirable particularly the areas\nwhere the DWR coverage is not at all there. Thus 1 to 3 hourly gauge-adjusted DWR rain\nrates, and hourly and daily gauge rainfall obtained from the IMD stations are important. The\nEta / IMD model forcast/analysed fields of total precipitable water (TPW) and relative\nhumidity fields should be available from IMD at every 3 hourly within 0.5x0.5 respectively.\nParameter Resolution Accuracy Source\nTotal Water Vapour 0.5 X 0.5 deg - Eta Model Analysis\n(IMD) (500 mb to\n- surface)\nRelative Humidity 0.5 X 0.5 deg Eta Model Analysis\n- (IMD) (500 mb to\nsurface)\nDoppler Weather Radar - 0.25 X 0.25 deg DWR observations at\nSurface Rain IMD Sites (Every 1-3\nHour, in 0.250x0.250\nSurface Rain Gauge on grids\nhourly basis (from Fast\nResponse Rain Gauges,\nAWS ) and Total Day ------ Do ------\nbasis\n1.

Grid mode\n0.250 X 0.250 data\n4.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n4.4.1 Overview:\nNOAA/NESDIS emphasizes use of meteorological satellites for the study of flash floods.\nHeavy precipitation and flash floods are often a multi scale and concatenating event from the\nglobal scale to the synoptic scale, to the mesoscale and finally to the storm scale. Satellite-\nderived algorithms, conceptual models, and interpretation techniques are used to provide\ninformation on these various scales to monitor, assess, and predict heavy precipitation and\nflash floods. In the satellite data, global scale connections between the tropics and middle\nlatitudes are observed. These connections are movements, surges, or plumes of water vapor\nthat are often associated with unstable air and prepare the environment for heavy\nprecipitation and flash floods. On the synoptic scale, the 6.7 ÔÅ≠m water vapor is especially\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 50\nSea surface temperature\nuseful for detecting jet streaks, vorticity centers and other features that are associated with\nupward vertical motion and lift the moist, unstable air resulting in the production of clouds\nand precipitation. Whether or not heavy precipitation and flash floods will occur are\ngenerally determined on the mesoscale to storm scale. On the mesoscale, infrared (10.7 ÔÅ≠m\nand 3.9 ÔÅ≠m), visible, and water vapor (6.7 ÔÅ≠m) are used to locate boundaries (both frontal\nand thunderstorm-produced) and short waves that may initiate, focus, and maintain the heavy\nprecipitation. Terrain features such as orographic uplift have the same effect of anchoring,\nintensifying, and prolonging the precipitation. On the storm scale, the intensity, movement,\nand propagation of the precipitation system (e.g., thunderstorms) is used to determine how\nmuch, when, and where the heavy precipitation is going to move during the next zero to three\nhours (called Nowcasting). High resolution infrared (10.7 ÔÅ≠m) and visible are the principal\ndata sets used in this diagnosis.\nLarge scale precipitation values are of importance in many fields and anomalies in large scale\nprecipitation are also known to have a close relationship with global circulation anomalies.\nSatellite based rain estimation techniques can be classified into two broad categories, viz, (1)\nestimation of precipitation on near real time, e.g. Scofield and Oliver (1977), etc. and (2)\nestimation of average precipitation over a large area for a period of time ranging from a day\nto a month e.g., Richards and Arkin (1981) etc. In any of these two the estimation criteria is\nbased on some statistical relationship.\nIn case of GOES, data from five channels are used: the visible channel (0.65 mm), used when\navailable to select optically thick clouds; channel 2 (3.9 mm), used to retrieve reff of\nhydrometeors during daytime; the water vapor channel (6.7 mm); and thermal channels 4 (11\nmm) and 5 (12 mm). The 11 mm channel is used to determine cloud-top brightness\ntemperature, and the 12-mm channel is used in conjunction with the 11-mm channel to\nestimate cloud-top temperature. The estimated cloudtop temperature is utilized to compute\nthe thermal emission at 3.9 mm, which is then subtracted from measurements of that channel\nto yield the reflected solar radiation in the 3.9-mm spectral band.\nIn the statistical relationship between IR cloud pixel brightness temperature from satellite\nsensor and surface rainfall measurements the mean rainfall rate R varies as a function of\nbrightness temperature (BT). But the uncertainty in rainfall rate is quite large and also varies\nwith BT. The GPI method uses a simple two-piece threshold function approximation of this\nrelationship Although crude, the GPI method works quite well for the estimation of monthly\nrainfall over large areas, partly because the over- and underestimation of spatial and temporal\nerrors cancel each other in the aggregation procedure.\nComplete software package for derivation of QPE using Kalpana-1, INSAT-3A, INSAT-3D\nVHRR data from two important algorithms like GPI, and IMSRA has been asked for. Both of\nthem are the operational at NOAA/NESDIS and has been developed after years of research\nand development efforts by various investigators. The theoretical background for GPI and\nGMSRA respectively are given below:\n4.4.1.1. Theoretical Background for GPI Algorithm:\n4.4.1.1.1 Physical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images\nThe satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the\natmosphere or from the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated\nover all wavelength, by Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 51\nSea surface temperature\ntemperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium\nemits spectral radiant energy according to some temperature less than its thermal temperature,\nthan a second factor called emissivity is introduced. The emissivity of a body determine its\nemission efficiency. Thus, we can define brightness temperature of a body T , which is\nb\nrelated to its physical temperature T by following equation:\nT = ÔÅ• T\nb\nwhere, ÔÅ• is emissivity of the object. If. ÔÅ• = 1, T = T, its a black body; if ÔÅ• = 0, T = 0, its a\nb b\nwhite body; if 0 < ÔÅ• < 1, Tb < T, and its a gray body.\nThe IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 ÔÅ≠m. This is a\natmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In\nthis band the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous\nconstituents of the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation,\nmeasured intensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those\nsurfaces, which are not opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated\nby effective emissivity times fourth power of the temperature. This effective emissivity will\nbe referred more often as cloud emissivity here after. The cloud emissivity cannot be\nmeasured from observations at a single wavelength interval. Often it is simply assumed to be\nunity. Then the temperature calculated from observed intensity of radiation is called\n`brightness temperature‚Äô. Only when ÔÅ• = 1, brightness temperature equals to black body\ntemperature.\nThe value of IR measurements to rainfall estimate lies in the nearly universal condition of\nlapse of temperature with height through the troposphere. If the temperature is known with\nheight, either from actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be\ninfrared from the satellite IR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this\ncontext, because ÔÅ• < 1 implies clouds which are thin (and therefore without precipitation).\nThe more serious problem is distinguishing between cold clouds that are radiometerelly thick\nbut are confined to the upper and middle troposphere, and cold clouds which extend into\nlower troposphere.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 52\nSea surface temperature\n4.4.1.1.2 Flow Chart for QPE from GPI:\nINSAT IR Data\n3 Hourly Image\nConversion from Grey Look Up Table for\nCount to TBs Calibration\nDetection of Deep\nGeneration of 24\nConvective Clouds\nClasses Histogram,\nmean & variance\nFractional Rain\nCloud Coverage\nRainfall Validation\nEstimation of Rainfall\n(DWR/SFRG)\nEstimation of daily\nRainfall (8 images)\nEstimation of Monthly Estimation of Seasonal\nRainfall Rainfall\n4.4.1.1.3 Operational Implementation\nStep 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT\nThe INSAT-3D infrared thermal images of 0000, 03000, 0600, ‚Ä¶., 2100 UTC, i.e.,\nevery three hours, are to be used. Infrared pixel has dimensions of 8 x 8 km in case of\nKALPANA and INSAT-3A and 4x4 km in case of INSAT-3D, so that several pixels\nfall within 1.00x1.00 box. The grey shade value (0-1023) of each pixel in a given\nimage is read and the corresponding brightness temperature is to be calculated from a\nlook-up table. Pixel lying outside the chosen area of analysis are to be ignored while\nwithin it are assigned to appropriate box.\nStep 2: Histogram Generation:\nAfter the temperatures of all the pixels in a box are known they are to be distributed\nto generate 3 hourly 24 class histogram of brightness temperatures of IR (11 um)\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 53\nSea surface temperature\nimages for 1.0 x 1.0 deg latitude /longitude boxes in an area -50 to + 50 deg. lat and\n30 to 130 deg longitude from the sub-satellite point.\nStep 3: Grid-wise Statistics\nGenerate 3 hourly mean and spatial variance of temperatures at 1.0 x 1.0 deg\nlatitude/longitude within the area 40 deg lat/long from the sub-satellite point.\nStep 4: Grid-wise Rain Clod Detection:\nThe fractional cloud coverage within a grid box is the ratio of the pixels of cooler\nthan specified threshold temperature to the total number of pixels. This gives the\nmeasure of the fractional area of the box covered by clouds with tops colder than\nthreshold. Finally the estimates of precipitation using the GPI technique in the grid\nspacing of 1.0ÔÇ∞ x 1.0ÔÇ∞ lat/lon will be carried out. This work indicated a high\ncorrelation between the fractional coverage of \"cold\" clouds and observed rainfall. It\nwas determined that the highest correlation between the parameters was produced\nusing a 1.0 degree latitude/longitude spatial scale. An estimation method using linear\nregression was developed. The regression procedure yielded the simple estimation\nequation:\nR = [3 mm h-1] X [frac] X [hours]\nwhere R is the rainfall estimate in millimeters; frac is the fractional coverage of\ncloud-top temperature < 235K for the desired 1.0 degree latitude/longitude region;\nand hours indicate the number of hours in the observation period.\nStep: 5 Sub-Grid Scale Rainfall:\nIn order to produce precipitation estimates at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, it\nis necessary to develop an improved method. Sub ‚Äìgrid scale is possible with help of\nrecent developments at NOAA/NESDIS. However, the GPI algorithm will also be\nattempted to provide at 0.5 degree latitude/longitude grids by some alternative\napproach. Based on this algorithm QPE on daily, pentad, moving average, monthly\nmean, seasonal mean and annual mean will be produced.\nStep: 6 Validations:\nRegarding the validation of the derived QPE the DWR (at present four at Chennai,\nSHAR, Kolkatta, Machliputtnam and some more are planned by IMD) and Surface\nRain Gauges (SFRG) Data at different spatial and temporal scales will be highly\ndesirable in and around the maximum validation sites in temporal window of every\nhour.\nRemarks:\nDuring the days when all the 8 images per day are not available, rain rate will be provided\nwith a flag. Provisions of average rainfall estimation will be made for all the cases when\nmore than 50% of data is available. Similar approach will be followed with the Pentad or\nMonthly scale average rainfall estimates.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 54\nSea surface temperature\n4.4.1.2 IMSRA technique:\n4.4.1.2.1 Theoretical Background:\nThe developmental work related to the INSAT Multi-Spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA)\nproposed here as an inhouse R & D effort, originally follows the GMSRA approach along\nwith innovative alternative features (i.e. the satellite microwave radiometric measurements)\nfor the estimation of precipitation. The theoretical basis is that\n1. Bright clouds in the VIS and clouds with cold tops in the IR imagery that are\nexpanding (in early and mature stages of development) produce more rainfall.\n2. Clouds with cold tops that are becoming warmer produce little or no rainfall.\n3. Merging of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds increases the rainfall rate of the merging\nclouds.\n4. Most of the significant rainfall occurs in the upwind (at anvil level) portion of a\nconvective system.\n5. Cloud micro-physics plays an important role in understanding the precipitation and\nthus effective radius of cloud top temperatures are to be known (say 3.9 mm during\nday time).\n6. The humidity and total precipitable water as a background field characterizes the\nrainfall process identification.\n7. For each pixel classified as containing raining clouds based on above criterions, the\nassociated instantaneous rain rate can be computed using pre-calibrated mean rain\nrate for cloud top brightness temperature using Satellite Passive Microwave\nRadiometer (e.g. TRMM-TMI) and/or Active Microwave Radar (TRMM-PR).\n8. Finally the retrieved rainfall from earlier step and Doppler Weather Radar data on\navailable locations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the\nalgorithm.\n9. Production of rainfall maps on every 3 hourly and daily basis on 0.50 x0.50 and above\ngrid spacing.\nSeveral such features are integrated in finalizing the estimation of rainfall using\nmeasurements from mult-spectral channels (Vis, IR, WV and microwave etc.). Physical\nexplanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images have been discussed previously which is\ncommon for GPI algorithm. In addition the Physical explanation of rainfall with visible (vis)\nimages is being presented here in brief. Various researches so far have pointed that that with\nthicker clouds the probability of rainfall and rain intensity is increased. This relationship is\nstrongest for clouds warmer than -15¬∞ C. It is also noted that marine clouds produce heavier\nrainfall. The possible explanation for this lies in the process of cloud growth and droplet\ngrowth rates. In clouds warmer than -15¬∞ C, precipitation results from coalescence. The large\ncloud thickness allows more time for growth before droplets fall out of the cloud. However,\nthe other factors like droplet concentration, evaporation and cloud temperature are also\nimportant. Difference in precipitation probability between marine and continental clouds\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 55\nSea surface temperature\nwere attributed to difference in concentration of condensation nuclei and of droplets, and\ndifference in evaporation below the cloud base.\nSatellite passive microwave and more recently, active microwave rain radar are able\nto provide accurate estimation of rain rates. However they are known to have but poor\ntemporal sampling. Again the estimates from polar orbiting satellites are subject to the bias\nin regions where diurnal cycle of rainfall is pronounced. Still the instantaneous\nmeasurements of rainfall from microwave sensors are more accurate and thus are useful in\ncalibrating other sensors like visible and IR. At present, the algorithms for the quantitative\nestimation of rainfall from microwave observations are quite successful but suffer from a\nscarcity of sufficient verification data over the oceans. Theoretical and empirical studies\naddressing the problem of rain retrieval and their critical assessment continues to appear. A\ndefinitive algorithm is contnuously in developing stage because of the complex and variable\nmicrophysical and mesoscale structure of precipitation vis-√†-vis coarser resolution of\nmicrowave sensors. As a source of microwave measurements, we use the rainfall data from\nthe SSM/I Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Several algorithms have been\ndeveloped for various SSM/I sensors of the DMSP series. The SSM/I rainfall used here is\nbased on Ferraro and Marks (1995). The SSM/I had a conical scan with a swath width of\nabout 1400 km and TRMM has swath width of about 800 km and the rainfall is retrieved by\nNASA-GPROF (Goddard Profiling) algorithm. Use of microwave data with those of VI/IR is\nmost plausible choice to mitigate the problem of resolution in microwaves and augmentation\nof rain estimates from IR measurements.\nFollowing the main features of Ba and Gruber (2001), from GMSRA, that combines mul-\ntispectral measurements of the satellites to estimate rainfall along with the present algorithm,\nIMSRA is thus proposed in combination with additional satellite microwave measurements.\nThus the principal innovations of IMSRA relative to previous infrared/visible algorithms\nalone is that it combines several cloud properties used in a variety of techniques in a single\nand comprehensive rainfall algorithm. For example, the technique uses cloud-top\ntemperatures as a basis of rain estimation (e.g., Arkin and Meisner 1987; Ba et al. 1995;\nVicente et al. 1998), and it utilizes the effective radii of cloud particles (e.g., Rosenfeld and\nGutman 1994) and spatial and temporal temperature gradients (e.g., Adler and Negri 1988;\nVicente et al. 1998) to screen out nonraining clouds. The algorithm have the following steps\nwhich are heavily drawn from (Ba, M., and A. Gruber, 2001).\nStep 1. Screening Method:\nOne of the most important aspects in estimating rainfall using IR measurements is to\ndistinguish nonprecipitating cirrus from active cold convective clouds. To remove cirrus\nclouds, an empirical procedure developed by Adler and Negri (1988) was adapted in\nNOAA/NESDIS for areas smaller than originally applied. A slope (S) and a temperature\ngradient (G,) are computed for each local temperature minimum in a window of 25 GOES\npixels [note that Adler and Negri (1988) searched an entire cloud area for points colder than\ntheir neighbors]. The terms G, and S are given by Eq. (I) and Eq. (2), respectively:\nGt = T -T and (1)\navg min\nS = 0.568 (T -217) (2)\nmin\nwhere T min is the local minimum in the window of 25 X 25 pixels, and as in Adler and\nNegri (1988), Tavg is the mean temperature of the 6 pixels surrounding the current pixel (4\npixels along the scan and 2 pixels across the scan because the pixel offset along the scan is\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 56\nSea surface temperature\napproximately one-half as large as across the scan). Based on G and S the decision is made\nabout the cirrus delineation.\nThere are many channels needed for this screening procedure and has been originally\ndeveloped only for mid latitudes, we are aware of a more recent cloud classification approach\nby CNES as an alternative (Roca et al. 2002). This method is based on classification of clear\nsky, low clouds, warm semitransparent clouds, mid-to-upper level clouds or without thin\ncirrus above, mid-to-upper level clouds, and finally deep convection with or without thin\ncirrus above.\nStep 2: Micro-physical properties of clouds:\nDuring the day time when the visible channel is available and the radiance at 3.9 mm is\ndominated by the solar reflected part, the effective radius of cloud particles at the cloud tops\ncan be computed for overcast pixels. As stated by Ba and Gruber (2001), the first step in\nderiving the effective particle radius consists of selecting only pixels filled with optically\nthick clouds because measurements obtained from thin clouds include radiances both emitted\nand reflected by clouds. For optically thick clouds defined as having a visible reflectance\ngreater than 0.40, the transmissivity at 3.9mm wavelength can be neglected. So with the\nassumption that the cloud is a Lambertian surface, the emissivity can be expressed by 1 - A,\nwhere A is the spectral albedo at 3.9 mm. Thus, the observed radiance L at 3.9 mm is then\ngiven by\nL = AS /œÄ + (1-A) P (3)\n0 EBB\nwhere So is the solar irradiance in the GOES 3.9-J.l0l band and PEBB is the equivalent\nblackbody emitted thermal radiation at 3.9 mm for cloud-top temperature T,. Thus, the albedo\nA is obtained from Eq. (4):\nA = L ‚Äì P\nEBB\n/(S\n0\n/ œÄ - P\nEBB\n) (4)\nThe effective radius of cloud particles is defined as\nÔÉ≤\nReff = ( N(r)r3dr ) / (N(r)r2 dr') (5)\nwhere N(r) is the number concentration of particles having radius r. The effective radius,\nwhich is dependent on the spectral albedo A at 3.9 ¬µm, is retrieved using the results obtained\nby Rosenfeld and Gutman (1994), which were tabulated in a lookup table of A versus r\neff\nusing an inversion of a radiative transfer model (Nakajima and King 1990). This is however,\na grey are of research and the studies for microphysical properties of clouds is replaced with\nmore innovative research element of using more physically based microwave observations of\nhydrometeors in synergism with the Geostationary infrared observations.\nStep 3. Pre-calibration of Rain Rate Using Satellite Microwave Data\nAfter the clouds are classified for their rain‚Äìno-rain baring properties, the IR radiances are to\nbe calibrated against the near instantaneously collocated microwave rainfall measurements.\nThe calibration with the contemporary satellites like TRMM and SSMI (whichever is\navailable during IR acquisitions) would be highly desirable. TRMM is a low inclination\ntropical orbiting, while SSM/I (at present two functional) are the polar orbiting satellites. The\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 57\nSea surface temperature\nrainfall estimation from these satellite sensors are based on NASA‚Äôs GPROF (Goddard\nProfiling) Algorithm. These are most reliable microwave satellite rainfall estimates for\ncalibrating the thermal IR radiances to estimate rainfall. A large data base of collocated\nINSAT-3D ‚Äì IR Radiances along with TRMM/SSMI rainfall rates will be generated over\nland and oceanic regions. The retrieval of rainfall thus, would be carried out using this data\nbase using multiple regression approach. The coefficients for land and oceanic regions will\nbe derived separately. Over land regions the further classification would be possible only\nafter extensive validations. The calibration with microwave derived rain will be dynamically\nupdated in case there are changes in the rainfall products itself.\nStep 4. Moisture Availability and Sub-cloud Adjustments:\nA moisture correction factor is to be used to adjust for the tendency of the overestimation of\nprecipitation in wet regions and underestimate in dry regions (Vicente et al. 1998). This\ncorrection factor, as first proposed by Scofield (1987) consisted of the precipitable water\n(PW, in inches) and relative humidity (RH, expressed as a decimal fraction) from the 500\nhPa to surface layer of the IMD model. The functional form of rainfall and IR brightness\ntemperature relationship would be further developed under different moisture conditions. The\nrelationship is adjusted by moisture factor, which is designed to modulate the evaporation\neffects on rain below cloud base for different moisture environments. The amount of\nmoisture factor will also determine the growth factor along with the successive image data.\nThus the final rainfall equations will be different for different RH and PW amounts so that\nthe real time PW and RH data can be ingested properly with a priori knowledge well\nestablished for the region of study/operation.\nStep 5: Calibration and validation and Fine Tuning of algorithm:\nFinally the retrieved rainfall from earlier steps and Doppler Weather Radar data on available\nlocations in India would be used both for calibration and validation of the algorithm. The\nerror analysis will be carried out and accordingly the algorithm will be fine tuned. A\ncomplete error statistics (regression, correlation, RMSE, BIAS, Mean, Standard Deviation\netc.) will be performed for the desired period (validation period of about 3-4 months).\nStep 6: Generation of Rainfall maps:\nRainfall maps on every 3 hourly and daily basis on 0.50 x0.50 and bigger grid spacing will be\nproduced with all provisions to have maximum possible information (like contours, color\nshades, statistical information etc.). Based on this algorithm QPE on daily, pentad, monthly\nmean, seasonal mean and annual mean will be produced. The capability of to derive QPE\nfrom IMSRA over meteorological subdivisions will be attempted along with Image Analysis\nSystem Group. Accordingly the algorithm will be made operational after due testing and\nvalidation.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 58\nSea surface temperature\n4.4.1.2.2 Flow Chart for IMSRA Algorithm\nINSAT TIR, WV Data\n3 Hourly Image\nConversion from Grey Look Up Table for\nCount to TBs Calibration\nIR and WV - Cloud Classification\n(Deep Convective (DC),\nDC with/without thin Cirrus (DCC), Grid Average of\nMid to upper level clods IR TBs (0.250x0.250) Satellite Microwave\nwith/without thin Cirrus and others\nRainfall (TRMM/SSMI)\nCollocation of IR TBs Grid Avg.

The hourly rainfall from rain gauges and DWRs and the IMD\nmodel forecasts from IMD in proper grid sizes (3-6 hourly, 0.5x0.5 deg. grid) are\nessential. In addition, the advanced approach suggested here to use satellite microwave\ninformation to augment thermal IR rainfall measurements along with VIS and WV\nwould also require a large R & D effort (in terms of man hours).\n4.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nQPE (GPI) mm 0 72 mm/ day TBD 1.0x1.0 and\n0.5x0.5 deg\nHistogram K < 180 K > 280 K 24 Class 1.0 x 1.0\nof BT‚Äôs\nDaily, Pentad, mm 0 72 mm/day TBD 1.0 x 1.0\nMonthly & seasonal\nrainfall\nQPE (IMSRA) mm 0 TBD TBD 1.0x1.0 and\n0.5x0.5 deg\nHistogram\nof BT‚Äôs K < 170 K > 300 K 24 Class -- do --\nDaily, Pentad, mm 0 TBD TBD -- do --\nMonthly & Seasonal\nrainfall\n4.5.1 Format of the output and the domain\nBasic format would be to obtain QPE on a give domain with geolocation, and rainfall values.\nHowever, the QPE would be represented in various shades, contours and with desired\ncolor coding thereof.

These are required to be used for many diverse meteorological,\nclimate, hydrological, agricultural, and other applications. It is therefore important to have an\nidea of their accuracy and expected error characteristics. This is done by validating the\nsatellite precipitation estimates against \"ground truth\" from rain gauge and radar observations.\nA thorough verification of satellite-based precipitation products should quantify their\naccuracy in a wide range of weather and climate regimes, give users information on the\nexpected errors in the estimates, help algorithm developers understand the strengths and\nweaknesses of the satellite rainfall algorithms. To get good estimates of absolute accuracy\nsatellite products are verified against very high quality radar and gauge data. However, these\nsites are only few in number. To get estimates of regional and spatial accuracy it is necessary\nto use a much larger quantity of data, for example, from national rain gauge networks. While\nthese verification data are less reliable than those from high-quality sites, their errors are\nusually much smaller than those associated with the satellite estimates, at least on short time\nscales. For validation of QPE with the ground truth on different temporal and spatial scale are\nrequired mainly with the data of DWR and Rain Gauges.\n4.6.1 Data Required:\nThe following data for validation will be needed\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nDopple\nWeather Radar 0.250x0.250 -- -- IMD -\nAt all DWR\nlocations\n(Every 1\nHourly basis\n0.250x0.250\ngrids\nFast Response Ground Truth -- -- IMD -\nRain Gauges (over land and At all Daily\n(for hourly oceans) point observation\nrainfall) & observation sites and to\nOther Rain plan for\ngauge Data oceanic\nRain/day locations\nTotal Water 0.5 X 0.5 deg 3-6 hourly Eta\nVapour /IMD Model\nAnalysis from\nRelative 0.5 X 0.5 deg IMD, (500 mb\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 61\nSea surface temperature\nHumidity to surface)\nOrbital and Data available\nTRMM 3 hourly - through\nAnalysed Data 0.250x0.250 internet\nand 10 X 10\n4.6.2 Method of Validation:\nCurrently pulsed Doppler technique are applied in weather radars to map severe storm\nreflectivity and velocity structure with great success in showing in real time the development\nof cyclones providing quantitative measure of intensity, track and information on winds\nwithin and around the storm. By studying the characteristics of radar returns and analyzing\nthe variations in their amplitude (or power received) , phase or frequency shift or change in\npolarization state, DWR quantifies the different characteristics of the precipitating medium\nwithin the pulse volume. The amount of received power from the distributed target depends\non the number of particles within the pulse volume of the beam, their size, composition,\nshape, orientation etc.\nThe DWR‚Äôs are located at Kolkatat, Chennai, Muchlipattanm and Shri-Harikota\n(SHAR). The SHAR radar is S-band and Doppler. It is situated as an Island north of Chennai.\nAll are working operationally. DWR‚Äôs estimates 3 base products namely Reflectivity (Z),\nVelocity (V) and Spectrum Width (W) as a function of range. From these base products,\nadvanced data products are required to be generated to meet the validation needs.\nGround-based radar and gauge rainfall observations (from IMD, ISRO‚Äôs AWS etc), at\nhigh resolution (hourly), are thus required to be used for validating rain product. High\nresolution IMD DWR products (hourly 4 Km x 4 Km) is required for evaluation over several\nsmall size study sites with hourly (daily when hourly is not available) rain-gauge density, for\ninstance in 1¬∞x 1¬∞ degrees. The size of every validation study site varies from 0.5¬∞x 0.5¬∞ to\n2¬∞x 2¬∞ degrees, depending on the density and distribution of available hourly rain-gauge\nstations over the study site and horizontal rain extents. In case of proper validation of GPI\nrainfall in particular, which is for a grid size of 1.00 x1.00, there should be minimum 3 rain\ngauges (IMD or AWS) to average out for comparison within a GPI grid size. For IMSRA, an\nhourly, and daily DWR and rain gauge information would be required on routine basis,\npreferably in 0.250x0.250 or atleast in 0.5¬∞x0.5¬∞ grids.\nPre-launch Field Experiments\nPre-launch validation campaign will be launched for existing Kalpana, INSAT-3A\nbased rainfall algorithms as a prelude to INSAT-3D. A three months period will be selected\n(mainly rainy season) for collecting data from DWRs, all possible and quality assured rain\ngauges and the algorithm will be tested.\nPost-Launch Special Field Experiments\nMany of the present ground-truth observations data networks are being augmented\nfor the measurements of precipitation on ground. This includes the plans of IMD to put more\nDWR in various Indian regions. However, the existing ground based data sources will be\nutilized for the INSAT-3D Imager derived rainfall estimates. Some more details of the\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 62\nSea surface temperature\nvalidation campaigns (timing, location, instrumentation, etc.) will be decided later in mutual\nconsultation with IMD.\n4.7 Technical Issues: (Limitation etc.)\nThe approaches for the retrieval of rainfall from these two techniques are distinctly different\nwith different application areas in mind by NOAA. Thus the validity of these methods in\nIndian Tropical Regions is an important and still an open issue. For large scale rainfall GPI\ntechnique has been found suitable over tropical regions and can be implented.\nHowever, the inherent limitations of IR / VIS based methods due to their indirect\nmeasurements poses challenges for the accuracy of the rainfall products. More importantly\nGMSRA is the algorithms, which is a large effort from various scientific institutions put\ntogether for many years and then integrated at NOAA. To follow them for the algorithm\ndevelopment directly over tropical regions of India needs a lot of R & D, experience and\ninnovations pertaining to the region. It is because, some of the steps like the cloud\nmicrophysics (estimation of effective radius of cloud particles, their optical properties etc.)\nand associated parameters estimation are the important but grey areas of research and can be\naccomplished fully only with the R&D efforts and experience in the field.\nIn addition the GMSRA, however, is a highly specific to US regions particularly with very\nlarge spatial and temporal coverage‚Äôs of the background data of Doppler Weather Radars (as\na dominant characteristics of the algorithm) along with the satellite data. In case of GMSRA,\nsome of the efforts are highly innovative (optical and cloud microphysics) and as mentioned\nearlier we have proposed to alternatively apply some some advanced elements in our\nproposed IMSRA algorithm, so that the method is more prone to Indian tropical regions.\nHowever, the advanced approach suggested here to use microwave information from most\nrecent satellites like low/polar orbiting TRMM/SSM/I to augment thermal IR rainfall\nmeasurements along with VIS and WV channels from Geostationary satellite would also\nrequire large R & D efforts.\n4.8 Future Scope\nDue to the heterogeneity of precipitation over the Earth‚Äôs surface it is important that\ncorrections be applied time to time to the algorithms depending on region specific processes.\nConventional means are restricted primarily to certain-land regions, and although satellite\nmeasurements are now commonly available, these have limitations too. Frequent\nobservations from visible (VIS) and infrared (IR) sensors are hindered by the fact that\nestimates of precipitation are indirect and therefore prone to errors caused by cloud-top to\nsurface rainfall variations. More direct measurements of precipitation through the use of\npassive microwave (PMW) instruments are somewhat restricted due their relative infrequent\nsampling of precipitation. Thus the algorithms for merging of microwave data with IR\nimages to generate rainfall rates at the spatial and temporal resolutions of the IR sensor is\nhighly desirable. The combined approaches can improve rainfall estimates using the temporal\nsampling of the VIS/IR data and the more direct nature of the microwave estimates, avoiding\nthe mentioned weaknesses and re-inforce the mutual strengths. At present we have proposed\nto use Geostationary optical channels and low earth orbiting microwaves for the rainfall\nestimation by their inter-calibration process and finally validations with the ground truth. In\nfuture this approach can be further advanced by optimally integrating optical and microwave\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 63\nSea surface temperature\nmeasurements by proper data assimilation schemes which will provide better rainfall than\nany of the sensors (optical, microwave and ground truth) alone.\n4.9 References\n1.

Varma QPE from HE Baseline Document\nR M Gairola\n4.2 Introduction\nRainfall affects the lives and economies of a majority of the Earth's population. Rain systems,\nsuch as hurricanes, typhoons, monsoons, and fronts are crucial to sustaining the livelihood of\nmany countries. Excess rainfall can cause flood, property and crop damages. A deficiency\ncauses drought and crop failure. Flood is a disaster that often resulted from intense\nprecipitation in short time. Floods are among the most devastating national hazards in the\nworld, claiming more lives and causing more property damage than any other natural\nphenomena. Within the USA an average of more than 225 people are killed and more than\n$3.5 billion in property is damaged by heavy rain and flooding each year (1993, 1999).\nThese figures are more devastating for India with population over 1 billion. As of today, the\nfloods is one the greatest challenges in weather prediction.\nConventionally rainfall over the ground is measured using rain gauges and radar. Rain\ngauges offer point measurements and thus they do not represent spatial variability of the\nprecipitation that varies from few meters to several kilometers. The distribution of the rain\ngauges is far from adequate to present the meaningful variability for the study of various\nrain-induced events/processes, like flash flood, dam failure, river catchment, etc. On the\nother hand, radars are better representative of the areal rain, but their coverage is limited due\nto their high cost. The radar measurements often suffer due to poor calibration of radar\nreflectivity and also of Z -R relationship. Apart from that, ground clutter and anomalous\ne\npropagation also mars its usability. At the time of severe weather conditions, ground based\nobservation network often failed to work. In view of the limitations of the ground\nmeasurements, the most convenient means to measure the precipitation over large area is by\nusing the satellite-based methods. The satellites offer frequent uniform coverage over large\narea. However, the satellite measurements also suffer from large errors. While Vis./IR\nmethods suffer from their inability to sense hydrometeors (Bhandari and Varma, 1995),\nmicrowave measurements suffer due to so called beam filling problem, and uncertainty in the\ndrop-size distribution, drop temperature, fall velocity and shape and orientation of the drops\n(Varma et al, 2003, 2004 and Varma and Liu, 2006).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 67\nSea surface temperature\nIn this document, a new most advanced method is described for precipitation measurement.\nThis method called Hydro-Estimator (H-E) method is developed by Robert Kuligowaski\nutilizes the infrared (IR) measurements from a geostationary satellite and is operationally\nused at NOAA/NESDIS.\n4.2.1 Overview and Background\nScofield (1987) described a method for measuring the intense precipitation over a storm. His\nmethod called Interactive Flash Flood Analyzer (IFFA) that used half-hourly satellite images\nto measure the precipitation over the active area of a storm. His method utilized the skill of a\ntrained meteorologist to find out active portion of a storm. His method also utilized the\nprecipitable water (PW) and water vapour (WV) correction to make modifications for\ndry/wet environment and saturation level adjustments for rain that comes from the warm\nclouds. This method was very successful for precipitation measurement but was highly\nsubjective and needed continuous interaction of a trained meteorologist to decide the\nprecipitation amount. Due to this reason, it was not very easy to implement it with ease.\nSuccessively, an alternate method called Auto-Estimator was developed. The aim of the\nAuto-Estimator was to provide an automated method without human intervention and that\ncould take care of the subjective nature of the IFFA, but this method a failed on many\noccasions because many features of IFFA were not properly implemented in it. Hydro-\nEstimator is most recent of the attempts by NESDIS to improve and make IFFA automated.\nThe H-E incorporated many new features that were either not present in IFFA or were\ndefined differently.\nTill date there is no published literature on H-E method is available (or known to us). The\nmethod/procedure described in this document is based on pre-prints of a paper and personal\ncommunication with Dr. Robert Kuligowaski who pioneered in developing H-E method at\nNOAA/NESDIS.\n4.2.2 Objectives:\nÔÇ∑ To develop Hydro-Estimator method for precipitation measurement over Indian\nregion encompassing area between longitudes 30ÔÇ∞ E -to130ÔÇ∞ E and latitudes 50ÔÇ∞ N -\n50ÔÇ∞ S.\n4.3 Inputs\n4.3.1 Static Data:\nTopography data ‚Äì Etopo ‚Äì topography/elevation data from NGDC (USA).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 68\nSea surface temperature\n4.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and Spatial:pixel 10 bit - Derived from\ngeometric Temporal: raw data by\ncorrected gray 30 min DP\ncount values of\nTIR-1 channel\n(10.7 ÔÅ≠m)\nGray value to - - 0.3 K Derived by\nbrightness DP\ntemperature\nconversion table\nGeolocation file Spatial:pixel - 1 pixel Derived by\nTemporal: DP\n30 min\n4.3.3 Other Auxillary data and Model Inputs\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nEta Model - Spatial: pixel Provided by\nEquilibrium size IMD\nlevel in K Temporal:\n3/6 hourly\nEta model- Spatial: pixel Provided by\nobservations of size IMD\nwind at 850 hPa Temporal:\nand relative 3/6 hourly\nhumidity (%),\nand PW (inch)\nEta model - Spatial: pixel Provided by\nProfiles of size IMD\ntemperature and Temporal:\ndew point. 3/6 hourly\nIn RFP, IMD has proposed its own model instead of Eta model.

Identify areas of probable precipitation, through recognition of most rain/no-rain\nboundaries\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 69\nSea surface temperature\n2. Evaluate associated rainrate\n3. Combine (1) and (2) through time where estimates of total accumulated rainfall are\nrequired\nThe objective of present day satellite research is blending of different types of data, from\nboth satellite and non-satellite sources, into the `best possible‚Äô rainfall product.\nRainfall estimation using Visible and IR satellite rainfall algorithm - physical premise\n1. In the visible region of the spectrum the basic physical assumption is that cloud\nbrightness is an indicator of cloud thickness, and this inturn is an indicator of rainfall.\nUnfortunately these relationships are neither simple nor constant; for example, because\nby no means all bright clouds precipitate.\n2. In the thermal IR, the basic physical premise is that cloud top temperature is a function of\ncloud top height, and that higher and colder cloud tops evidence thicker clouds which are\nmore likely to rain. While this set of relationship is more often true than (1) above,\nunfortunately not all cold clouds precipitate, nor does rain always come from cold clouds.\nPhysical explanation of rainfall with infrared (IR) images\nThe satellite IR images are composed of measured radiant energy originating in the\natmosphere or from the land and water surface below. The intensity of this energy integrated\nover all wavelength, by Stefan-Boltzmann law, is proportional to fourth power of\ntemperature. The Stefan-Boltzmann law is valid for a perfect black body. If the medium\nemits spectral radiant energy according to some temperature less than its thermal temperature,\nthan a second factor called emissivity is introduced. The emissivity of a body determines its\nemission efficiency. Thus, we can define brightness temperature of a body T , which is\nb\nrelated to its physical temperature is T by following equation:\nT = ÔÅ• T\nb\nwhere, ÔÅ• is emissivity of the object. If. ÔÅ• = 1, T = T, its a black body; if ÔÅ• = 0, T = 0, its a\nb b\nwhite body; if 0 < ÔÅ• < 1, Tb < T, and its a gray body.\nThe IR, for rainfall estimation, refers to thermal IR band that is 10.0 - 12.5 ÔÅ≠m. This is a\natmospheric window, and all earthly objects radiate maximum spectral power in this band. In\nthis band the absorption is strong for clouds and land/water surfaces and slight for gaseous\nconstituents of the atmosphere. For surfaces, which are opaque and do not transmit radiation,\nmeasured intensity is closely approximated by the fourth power of the temperature. For those\nsurfaces, which are not opaque - such as some clouds - measured intensity is approximated\nby effective emissivity times fourth power of the temperature. This effective emissivity will\nbe referred more often as cloud emissivity here after. The cloud emissivity cannot be\nmeasured from observations at a single wavelength interval. Often it is simply assumed to be\nunity. Then the temperature calculated from observed intensity of radiation is called\n`brightness temperature‚Äô. Only when ÔÅ• = 1, brightness temperature equals to black body\ntemperature.\nThe value of IR measurements to rainfall estimate lies in the nearly universal condition of\nlapse of temperature with height through the troposphere. If the temperature is known with\nheight, either from actual sounding or from climatology, the height of the cloud can be\ninfrared from the satellite IR observations. Ordinarily, gray clouds are not useful in this\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 70\nSea surface temperature\ncontext, because ÔÅ• < 1 implies clouds which are thin (and therefore without precipitation).\nThe more serious problem is distinguishing between cold clouds that are radiometrelly thick\nbut are confined to the upper and middle troposphere, and cold clouds that extend into lower\ntroposphere.\nPhysical explanation of rainfall with visible (vis) images\nIn middle and late fifties and earlier sixties, various researches concluded that with thicker\nclouds the probability of rainfall and rain intensity is increased. This relationship is strongest\nfor clouds warmer than -15¬∞ C. It is also noted that marine clouds produce heavier rainfall.\nThe possible explanation for this lies in the process of cloud growth and droplet growth rates.\nIn clouds warmer than -15¬∞ C, precipitation results from coalescence. The large cloud\nthickness allows more time for growth before droplets fall out of the cloud. However, the\nother factors like droplet concentration, evaporation and cloud temperature are also important.\nDifference in precipitation probability between marine and continental clouds were attributed\nto difference in concentration of condensation nuclei and of droplets, and difference in\nevaporation below the cloud base. Very high droplet concentrations (> 400 cm3) inhibit\ncoalescence and formation of rain. The evaporation of raindrops is proportional to saturation\nvapor deficit and fall period. Both droplet concentration and subcloud moisture and thickness\nare more variable over land than over water. Temperature governs various processes. At\ntemperature ÔÇ£ -10¬∞ C growth of hydrometeors is dominated by sublimation and collisions\ninvolving ice particles; that is, by Wegener-Bergeron rather than coalescence processes. Less\nimportant factors influencing precipitation are condensation nuclei, updraft speed, and\nelectrification. Thus cloud thickness, though important, is one of the several factors\ndetermining production of rain in the clouds.\nVarious researchers have tried to related cloud thickness with satellite observed brightness.\nThe contradictory claims are made. Some of them have found high correlation between two,\nwhere as others could not notice so encouraging results with their studies. It is concluded that\ncloud brightness alone cannot always imply cloud thickness. In more than one instance,\nErickson and Hubert (1961) found in their study that large thunderstorms having vertical\ndepths of the order of 30000 feet appeared no brighter, than a rather dense overcast of much\nsmaller vertical extent.\nThe understanding of the factors governing cloud brightness is complicated as it is a\nproblem of optics that again requires an excursion into the theory of electromagnetic\nradiation.\nThe light scattering from water clouds can be described as a problem of effect of light\nscattering by particles of size comparable or slightly more than the wavelength of the\nincident light. For water clouds, the particles (or droplets) may vary in size (the number of\nparticles as a function of their size), and the cloud geometry is variable (the arrangement of\nparticles in relation to the incident beam of solar radiation). This problem is generally treated\nin two parts: single scattering and multiple scattering.\nThe single scattering theory describes the fate of incident light in a very small part of a\nnatural cloud. The aggregate effect on the incident beam of all parts of a cloud is treated\nthrough the theory of multiple scattering. Here, the dimensions of the cloud and its\norientation with respect to a given incident beam become important.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 71\nSea surface temperature\nTwomey et al. (1967) calculated reflectance as a function of geometric thickness for a cloud\ndrop distribution of 6 ÔÅ≠m average radius and 1 ÔÅ≠m standard deviation. Liquid water content\nwas 0.2 and 0.4 gm- 3, and two solar zenith angles were considered. They found that\nreflectance increases rapidly in hyperbolic fashion for both values of liquid water content,\nimplying little additional increase above the thickness of 0.7 km. The effect of absorption\nwas to increase the rate of hyperbolic convergence. Changing solar zenith angle had little\neffect (though at large zenith angles reflectance would approach unity), and the effects on\nreflectance of changing drop size distribution radius and variance were small for optical\nthickness, ÔÅ¥ > 100.\nThe radiance (brightness) from the striated cloud is larger than plan parallel radiance in\nantisolar direction with inclined illumination (Wending, 1977). Wending tested two drop size\ndistributions, one peaking at r ~ 5 ÔÅ≠m and other at 5 ~ 2 ÔÅ≠m, both appropriate to stratus\nclouds. The difference in albedo and radiance at small zenith angles were comparable to\ndifferences resulting from geometry of the cloud top; however, these also decreased with\nincreasing optical thickness. Therefore, at optical thickness typical of precipitating clouds,\ntexture and drop size distribution may be of secondary importance in explaining cloud\nbrightness. McKee and Klehr (1978) with their RT (radiative transfer) model found that\ncloud geometry is far more important factor than drop size distribution.\nA composite picture emerging out of various studies in the past has proved the main factors\ngoverning cloud brightness are:\nÔÇ∑ thickness\nÔÇ∑ the area to volume ratio\nÔÇ∑ orientation of solar beam\nThese factors collectively called geometry, determine optical path within the cloud. Drop size\ndistribution and liquid water content are secondary in importance. Background albedo may\nbe significant over land areas. Interactions apparently are important when clouds are close\ntogether. The phase is not appears to be an important variable.\nThe proposed method is the H-E method as developed at NOAA/NESDIS. The details of\nthis method are described in the next section.\nRetrieval Algorithm Method\nThe H-E method described in this section is based on pre-prints of a paper by Kuligowaski et\nal. (2003). This paper is received from the author through personal communication.\nThe H-E method offers improvement over A-E method for precipitation estimation. In A-E\nmethod, the relationship between 10.7 ÔÅ≠m brightness temperature (Tb ) and rain rate (mm\n10.7\nh-1) (R) is defined as:\n12\nR = a exp(-bTb ), -----(1)\n10.7\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 72\nSea surface temperature\nwhere, a and b are regression coefficients having values a= 1.1183*1011; b=0.036382\n(Vicente et al. 1995). The A-E method provides same relationship for convective and non-\nconvective precipitation. The above equation provides first guess of the precipitation value.\nIn H-E method, convective and non-convective cores are identified and different R-Tb\nrelationships are provided for them. This allows higher precipitation rates for the convective\ncores. For convective core, an equation similar to (1) is used, however the coefficients a and\nb are varied as per precipitable water (PW) provided by Eta model. This allows higher\nprecipitation value for wetter atmosphere. The above (1) is constrained such a way that it\nyields a value of 0.5 mm h-1 of rain rate at 240 K, and a precipitable water (from Eta model)\ndependent value at 210 K of Tb . In H-E method, the maximum possible rain value at any\n10.7\npixel is limited depending upon availability of PW. This allows the maximum precipitation to\nbecome a function of available moisture. The maximum possible rain value in mm h-1 is\ngiven as 40 times the precipitable water in inches.\nIf a pixel is assigned maximum rain but there exist a colder pixel in its vicinity. In principle,\nthe rain rate at the colder nearby pixel would be higher. Thus the rain rate curves are\nrecomputed based on rain rate of 0.5 mm/h at 240 K and of the theoretical maximum value at\nthe lowest temperature in the vicinity.\nFoa a non-convective core, the relationship between Tb and R is given as:\n10.7 s\nR =(250-Tb ) * (R /5) -----------------(2)\ns 10.7 max\nR is again a function of PW. The relationship between R and PW is not known in this\nmax max\ncase and needs to be determined. R is not allowed to exceed - corresponding convective rain\ns\nrate (R ) or 12 mm h-1, whichever is lower.\nc\nThe relationship between Eta model derived PW and R (in mm h-1) at 210 K is shown in\nfigure 1(a). The figures 1 (b) and 1(c) shows the relationship between R and Tb at\n10.7\ndifferent PW values for convective and non-convective cores, respectively. These figures are\ntaken from the pre-prints of Kuligowaski et al. (2003).\nIn H-E method, the precipitation at a pixel is allowed to be combination of both convective\nand non-convective core. This is worked out by considering a pixel box of 101X101 pixels\nsurrounding the pixel of interest. The minimum, mean and standard deviation of Tb (T ),\n10.7 min\nin this pixel box is determined. This T is used to find the radius of actual region of interest.\nmin\nWithin this radius of interest, the mean (T ) and standard deviation (ÔÅ≥) of Tb is\nmean m10.7\ndetermined. The active/inactive and also core/non-core fraction of the pixel is determined\nthrough the parameter Z, which is defined as:\nZ = (T - Tb )/ ÔÅ≥ ----------(3)\nmean 10.7\nThe maximum allowable value of Z is 1.5.\nIf Z < 0; R = 0, i.e., pixel either cirrus or inactive convective\nOtherwise, RR = [R *Z2 + R * (1.5 - Z)2] / [Z2 + (1.5 - Z)2] --------------(3)\nc n\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 73\nSea surface temperature\nR is the rain from the convective core given by (1) with coefficients determined by PW from\nc\nEta model. R is rain from non-convective core given by (2). If Z=1.5, the pixel rain rate RR\nn\nreduces to convective type only (given by (1)). On the other hand, if Z=0, the pixel rain rate\nRR is determined by purely non-convective rain (given by (2)).\nIn fact, the convective systems generally have multiple brightness temperature minima, and\nhence a single radius is inappropriate for differentiating local from global minima. Thus, this\nsame computation of rain rate is performed for a smaller (15-pixel) radius, and the final rain\nrate is the square root of the product of the two rates. The exception to this is if the rain rate\ncomputed from the smaller radius is zero, in which case it is not considered in the final rain\nrate calculation.\n(This figure is taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowski et al. (2003))\nThe (3) above provides the first guess precipitation amounts. The precipitation thus estimated\nis further modified to account for the wetness/dryness of the atmosphere and also for the\nprecipitation that comes from the warm clouds. The several steps involved for such\nmodifications are as follows:\n(a) Correction for Wet/dry Environment\nA small correction in the brightness temperature (Tb ) values is carried out to account for\n10.7\nwetness of the environment. This adjustment is needed to account for evaporation of the\nprecipitation in the dryer environment below the cloud. A higher or lower value of the\nbrightness temperature at 10.7ÔÅ≠m is set for dry or wetter environment. This is carried out in\ntwo steps. In the first step, brightness temperature is adjusted based on the PW value to\ncompute rain rate from (3). This is shown in Fig. 2 (a), where brightness temperature\ncorrection is additive or subtractive depends upon value of PW. In the second step, first, the\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 74\nSea surface temperature\nRH itself from the Eta model is adjusted to account for the falling rain, and then depending\nupon RH value, a subtraction from the rain amount given by (3) is made. Fig. 2(b) shows the\ncorrection of RH as a function of rain. Fig. 2(c) shows the correction rain amount as a\nfunction of corrected RH.\n(This figure is taken from the pre-prints of Kuligowski et al. (2003))\n(b) Warm-top modification\nThe equilibrium level is computed by following a parcel along a saturation adiabat upward\n(from lifting condensation level) to where the parcel temperature becomes equal to the\nenvironmental temperature. Strength of the convection is determined by a comparing the\ntemperatures of the convective tops with that of equilibrium level. This level comes before\ntropopause for the warm rain.\nIn H-E method, Eta model temperature and dewpoint profiles are used to determine\nequilibrium temperature of a particulate pixel. This correction is applied to pixels that are\nwarmer than the equilibrium level temperature.\nÔÇ∑ If the (T - T ) < 10 K, then T in the pixel-area is used instead of Tb of the\neq min min 10.7\npixel for warm top correction. The modification is as follows:\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 75\nSea surface temperature\nTb ‚Äì [(213-T )*0.9] or 25 K (whichever less)\n10.7 eq\nÔÇ∑ If the (T - T ) > 10 K, the modification is as follows\neq min\nTb ‚Äì [(213-T )*0.6] or 15 K (whichever less)\n10.7 eq\n(c) Orography and Parallax correction\nOrography adjustment is carried out using 850 ‚ÄìhPa Winds and topography from a digital\nelevation model at 4 km resolution to derive vertical component of wind (Vicente et al.,\n2002). This vertical wind component is then scaled into a multiplicative adjustment to the\nrain rate.\nThe parallax correction described in the same paper, adjusts the horizontal location of the\nsatellite pixel prior to rain rate computation, based on cloud height (using T and standard\nb\natmosphere) and satellite zenith angle.\nSatellite Zenith angle correction is carried out to take into accounts the increased path length\nat higher angles. A technique developed by Joyce et al. (2001) is used.\nDerived Products\nPrecipitation rain rate at 30 minute duration.\nIntegrated daily, weekly and monthly precipitation amounts.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 76\nSea surface temperature\n4.4.1.2 Flow Chart\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 77\nSea surface temperature\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 78\nSea surface temperature\n4.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min.

Despite of\nthese similarities, there is remarkable difference between these 2 comparisons, that is, the\ncorrelation between H-E and WWR varies from moderate a range of 0.64 to 0.90, whereas\nthat between TRMM 3B42 V7 and WWR varies from low value of 0.52 to high value of 0.93.\nThus statistics between H-E and WWR is more stable compared to that between TRMM\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 80\nSea surface temperature\n3B42 V7 and WWR. The comparison between TRMM 3B42 V7 and H-E is also attempted\nand is shown in the Table 1.6.2.\n4.6.2 Validation of daily 0.25ox0.25o grided rain\nThe comparisons in section 4.6.1 are carried out in weekly meteorological sub-division scales. The\nrain is known to have variability from few meters to continental scales and from few seconds to any\ntime scale. In shorter measuring scales, it behaves as quasi-random stochastic process. Therefore, rain\ncomparisons in shorter time scales and from observations in different spatial scales lead to large\nerrors (Piyush et al., 2012). Nevertheless, we have compared daily 0.25ox0.25o averaged rain from\nmodified H-E method with gridded dataset from IMD.

This is mainly due to spatially averaged measurement\nof rain from H-E and TRMM TRMM-3B42 V7. The Table 1.6.5 also shows the performance\nof modified H-E with respect to TRMM 3B42 V7 over oceans. It may be noted here that\nneither IMD WWR nor gridded dataset provides measurements over oceans. So the\ncomparison with TRMM 3B42 V7 is the only source for accessing the quality of H-E rain\nover oceans. It may be noted from Table 12 that daily 0.25ox0.25o gridded rain from H-E and\n3B42 V7 has a good agreement over oceans with correlation of 0.65 and rmse of 15.88\nmm/day.

The changes that are carried out in the modified algorithm are\nable to successfully represent the orographic rain which otherwise was not found to suffer\nfrom huge errors. The rain is highly variable parameter over space and time and its validation\nin smaller scales always resulting large huge errors (Piyush et al., 2012). The results\npresented above should be viewed with respect to validation comparison results of the global\nstandard rain products by other researchers. For example, in a recent study by Tan et al.\n(2015) in which they evaluated six high resolution precipitation products including TRMM-\n3B42 V7 over the Malaysia. They reported that among 5 satellite based rain products, the\n3B42 V7 and is the best performing with respect to surface observations, which on daily\nscale provides a correlation of 0.39 and rmse of 18.35 mm/day. While the India has much\nmore diverse surface and climatic conditions with different cloud types and wide range of\nprecipitation rates during S-W months, we achieve much higher correlation between\nmodified H-E rain with surface observations. A more important aspect of the rain from H-E\nvis-√†-vis TRMM 3B42 V7 is timely availability of H-E product from IMD and MOSDAC\nsites. The TRMM 3B42 V7 is available after latency of about 4 months, whereas INSAT-3D\nH-E is available within 15 minutes of data acquisition, which makes H-E very important for\noperational users, especially those working with rain related natural disasters, nowcasting\nand numerical weather predictions.\n4.7 Future Scope\nThe scheme has to be regularly calibrated with more varied calibration data. Further merging\nof H-E with microwave observations is desired for more accrate rain measurement.\n4.9 References\n1. Barrett, E. c., and D. W.

The inheritance of\nthis satellite has come from GOES series of NOAA. Meteorological payloads onboard\nwould be a 6 channel imager and a 19 channel sounder mainly for cyclone and monsoon\nmonitoring, cloud motion vectors winds, rainfall estimation, floods/intense precipitation\nmonitoring, snow cover detection, mesoscale studies etc. 19 channel Sounder, split\nthermal window channels, a mid IR thermal window channel and shortwave IR channel\nare the additions to earlier INSAT-3A/Kalpana satellites. Details of Imager channels are\ngiven in Table-1.\nSea surface temperature would be derived from split thermal window channels (10.2-\n11.3ÔÅ≠m, 11.5 ‚Äì12.5ÔÅ≠m) during daytime and using additional mid IR window channel (3.7\n‚Äì 4.1ÔÅ≠m) during nighttime over cloud free oceanic regions. The most important part of\nthe SST retrieval from IR observations is the atmospheric correction. Specially over\ntropics, this atmospheric correction is dominated by the high variability in vertical\ndistribution of the intervening atmospheric water vapor. This correction will be\ndetermined through suitable characterization of tropical atmospheres in radiative transfer\nmodel to simulate the brightness temperatures of INSAT-3D channels and then\ngenerating the regression coefficients for SST retrieval. Details of the algorithm have\nbeen given in section 1.4.1.1.\n5.2.1 Overview and background\nThis algorithm basis theoretical document (ATBD) describes our current working\nmodels of the algorithms for the retrieval of sea surface temperature from INSAT-3D\nimager channels data. While effort has been made to make this document as complete as\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 87\nSea surface temperature\npossible, it should be recognized that algorithm development is an evolving process. This\ndocument (V1.0) is a description of the prototype algorithm for INSAT-3D sea surface\ntemperature estimation as it currently exists, and is being delivered for inclusion in the\nINSAT-3D processing scheme.\nCurrent research on the physics of the atmospheric transmission in the infrared, the\nprocesses at the ocean surface, and new information about the performance of the satellite\nwill lead to periodic revisions of the algorithms. Also, the document may appear\nincomplete in places as research continues to improve our understanding of the processes\nat work. Subsequent revisions of the document will reflect new knowledge and, it is\nhoped, fill the gaps in what is reported here.\n5.2.2 Objective\nDevelopment of complete application software package for derivation of SST using multi\nchannel Imager data from INSAT-3D.\n5.3 Inputs\n5.3.1 Static Data\nParameter Resolution Accuracy Source\nLand /Sea Mask Pixel ( ~4 km) 1 pixel\nUSGS(available)\n5.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from\ngeometric raw data by\ncorrected gray DP\ncount values of\nChannel-5\n(10.2-11.3 ÔÅ≠m)\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from\ngeometric raw data by\ncorrected gray DP\ncount values of\nChannel-6\n(11.5-12.5 ÔÅ≠m)\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from\ngeometric raw data by\ncorrected gray DP\ncount values of\nChannel-3\n(3.8 ‚Äì 4.0 ÔÅ≠m)\nGray value to - - 0.3 K Derived by\nbrightness DP\ntemperature\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 88\nSea surface temperature\nconversion\nlookup table\nGeolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by\nDP\nSatellite Zenith pixel Derived by\nangle DP\nSolar Zenith pixel Derived by\nangle DP\nCloud Flag Pixel - - Cloud Routine\n5.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs\nParameter Resolution Accuracy Source\nClimatological 1 X 1 deg 0.5 K Reynolds\nSSTdata\nClimatological 1 X 1 deg 5 mm NVAP\nWV data\nTotal water 0.5 X 0.5 5 mm Model output,\nvapour deg IMD\n(In case of\nfailure of any\none of the split\nthermal channel)\n5.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n5.4.1 Overview\n5.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\nRadiance from Earth‚Äôs terrestrial emission peaks at around 9.6 ÔÅ≠m and it has\nminimum absorption by atmospheric gases, hence in order to measure earth‚Äôs temperature,\nspaceborne sensors are designed around this band (8-12ÔÅ≠m). Still this band is not\ncompletely transparent. Atmospheric water vapour and CO are the major components\n2\nthat attenuate the IR signal reaching at the top of the atmosphere. Since CO is a\n2\nuniformly mixed gas, its effect can be taken care, but water vapour being highly variable\nits effect can only be removed by its measurement(directly or indirectly). Retrieval of sea\nsurface temperature (SST) from thermal infrared window channels (10-12 ÔÅ≠m) requires\natmospheric corrections arising due to attenuation of signal by intervening moisture. This\ncorrection is more in tropics during summers due to higher amount of atmospheric\nmoisture (Barton 1983, Anding and Kauth 1970, Gohil et al 1994, Mathur & Agarwal\n1991, 2002, Shenoy 1999). Our radiative transfer simulations studies have shown that\nwith proper characterization of tropical marine conditions in the atmosphere, a suitable\nalgorithm can be developed for accurate SST retrieval (<0.7K) using split thermal\nwindow and mid IR thermal channels provided the sensor noise is of the order of 0.1K.\nThe regression equation to correct for atmospheric absorption and emission has the form\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 89\nSea surface temperature\nSST= A + A T + A dT + A dT2 (1)\n0 1 11 2 3\nWhere A A A and A are coefficients determined by simulation and may have satellite\n0, 1, 2 3\nzenith angle dependence\ndT = T ‚Äì T\n11 12\nT and T are brightness temperatures for the split-window channels.\n11 12\nTo determine the regression coefficients in the above equation, radiative transfer\nsimulations to generate INSAT-3D channels‚Äô brightness temperatures for Indian marine\ntropical environmental conditions would be carried out. The important step in regression\nis to ensure that the sample dataset is fully and solely representative of the population for\nwhich the SST is to be derived. Instrument noise in simulated data for INSAT-3D\nchannels would be introduced as per the availability from sensor team.\nA case study for SST retrieval using GOES-9 data (19th August 2005) yielded 0.68 K\nRMS deviation.\n5.4.1.1.1 Radiative Transfer Model\nTo simulate the brightness temperatures, MODTRAN is being used. MODTRAN is a\ncomputer code developed by Spectral Sciences Inc. and is designed to determine\natmospheric transmittance and radiance at moderate resolution (1 cm-1). It is based on\nAFGL‚Äôs LOWTRAN-7 code. Thermodynamic Initial Guess Retrieval (TIGR) dataset has\nbeen used to construct the tropical marine subset. These profiles have been extracted\nfrom 500 S ‚Äì 500 N and 300E ‚Äì 1200E. The simulations have been performed on each\nradio sounding of the TIGR \"tropical maritime\" subset under the following conditions:\n-TIGR profiles are available on 48 levels. They have been converted to the 34 level\nMODTRAN inputs by using directly the TIGR levels from the surface to 300 hPa (15\nlevels), sampling every 4 levels above 300 hPa (5 levels are excluded this way) and\nremoving the upper 9 levels.\n-In addition to the profiles of temperature and water vapor of TIGR, mixed gases profiles\nfrom MODTRAN standard atmospheres have been added according to the time and\nlocation of each radiosounding.\n-No aerosols have been considered.\n-Satellite zenith angles: 4 values of the secant have been retained: 1., 1.5, 1.75, 2. This\nsampling aims to detect possible non linearities in the dependance of any given quantity\nin function of sec(ÔÅ±).\n-Surface temperatures: For each radio sounding 3 surface temperatures have been\nassigned: Ta1000 (1000 mb air temperature), Ta1000+1C, Ta1000-1C.\n-Radiances have been simulated for INSAT-3A and INSAT-3D thermal channels (i.e.\n10.5-12.5 ÔÅ≠m, 10.3-11.3 ÔÅ≠m, 11.5-12.5 ÔÅ≠m, 3.7-4.1 ÔÅ≠m) with emissivity values\ncalculated from the tables of Masuda 1988 with a moderate wind speed of 5 ms-1 (see\ntable 1 below). They have been calculated for each channel as means of tabulated values\nat the central and neighbouring wavelengths to account for the width of the filter function.\nFor instance, emissivities for channels centred on 11 ÔÅ≠m were calculated as the mean\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 90\nSea surface temperature\nvalues of emissivities at 10.5 and 11 ÔÅ≠m, etc. They were then interpolated in function of\nsec(ÔÅ±) and used with a step of 0.0025 induced.\nRadiances will be integrated for each channel with the filter functions provided by Sensor\nGroup and converted into radiative temperatures.\nThe simulations applied on the \"tropical maritime\" subset of TIGR produced 5820 cases.\nBefore being used to derive algorithms, the simulated radiative temperatures were filtered.\nTo keep the simulated temperatures within realistic limits, the following thresholds were\nfinally applied on the simulation file:\nTs-T11 > 0.5C\n-2C < Ts < 35C\nW > 0.5 g/cm2\n5.4.1.1.2 Inversion Methods\nTo generate regression coefficients from the simulated brightness temperatures as per the\nform prescribed in equation (1), multiple regression using least square method will be\nadopted.\n5.4.1.1.3 Single Channel SST retrieval\nIn case of failure in any one of the thermal split channels, provisions are provided to\nretrieve SST using single functional channel (water vapour correction in that case will be\ncarried out by ingesting total water vapour content externally from model output, and\napplying water vapour dependent SST coefficients similar to SST retrieval from INSAT-\n3A/Kalpana data). If external total WV conetent is not available, climatological water\nvapor will be used.\nSingle channel SST is computed as\nSST = a + b*Tb +c*WV\nWhere\nTb is brightness temperature of the IR imager channel, WV is total water vapour content,\na, b and c are regression coefficients generated through radiative transfer simulations and\nmay have satellite zenith angle dependence.\n5.4.1.1.4 Cloud Detection\nIn the present algorithm, cloudy pixels are detected through thresholding and spatial\ncoherence techniques in thermal band and the pixels are rejected based on the above\ncriterion. Thresholding technique assumes that over oceans in Indian domain brightness\ntemperature in thermal band is greatly affected by the presence of clouds, resulting in\ndecreased brightness temperature from cold cloud tops. Spatial coherence method is\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 91\nSea surface temperature\nbased on the assumption that SST is homogeneous and warmer than clouds; thus clouds\ncan be identified where the scene brightness temperature has lower mean value or larger\nstandard deviation. Further, the cloud flags generated by cloud mask routine will be used\nto detect the clouds. SST is computed only over clear oceanic regions.\n5.4.1.1.5 Error analysis\nThe uncertainty in the INSAT-3D SST retrieval is straightforward to calculate. Taking\nequation (1) and performing an error analysis, one sees that the error in SST can be\nrepresented\nas:\nwhere e is the total error, a are the estimation coefficients, and e is the error apparent\nt i i\nfor each band i used in the algorithm. e is given by\ni\nwith ea being the error due to atmospheric correction and NEÔÅÑT deriving from instrumental\ni i\ndesign and performance considerations. Since the constants a are order 1, and one assumes\ni\nthat the nadir and/or atmospheric errors are comparable and the various bands have similar\ncharacteristics, one can see the error scales as\nwhere n is the number of bands used.\nThis analysis makes clear the fact that calibration and/or atmosphere correction errors are\nimportant components of the error budget, i.e., 0.1K of error in calibration for a band is\neffectively an rms error in a dual band algorithm of 0.14K, assuming perfect atmospheric\ncorrection. Therefore, we have requested that the calibration be demonstrably accurate at\nthe choice of 0.05K level to minimize the effect of calibration errors. The best\natmospheric correction currently available for ATSR suggests that errors due to\natmospheric correction in optimal cases for a nadir viewing instrument are approximately\n0.3K [Mutlow, et al., 1994; Minnett, 1990; Barton, et al., 1993; Minnett, 1995b].\nIf one assumes that the calibration errors and the atmospheric errors are random and thus\ncan be RSS‚Äôd, as in the preceding analysis, one sees that expected errors of 0.35K-0.4K\nin the result are the best that can be expected for two-band configurations. This equation\nalso points out that there is a cost associated with adding more bands to improve\natmospheric correction. In addition to providing information potentially useful for\ncorrecting the effects of the intervening atmosphere, each additional band also introduces\nnoise into the SST retrieval.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 92\nSea surface temperature\n5.4.2 Flow-Chart:\nLookup\nTables\nINSAT-3D Grey Value\nCloud\nThermal To\nDetection\nband Brightness\nthreshold\nData Temperature\nConversion\nLand Sea\nMask\nLand/Sea Cloud\ndelineation Detection\nSpatial\ncoherence\nCloud\nMask\nRoutine\nSST\nMap Overlay\nRetrieval\nSST coefficients SST\nimage/data\nDay/Night Single/split\nFlag channel\nFlowchart of SST processing software for INSAT-3D\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 93\nSea surface temperature\n5.4.3 Operational Implementation\nStep-1.

In situ records that do not fall within the\nstipulated time window will be rejected. The in situ records that pass the temporal\nmatchup subsequently have to pass a spatial test. A maximum distance of 0.1¬∞ will be\naccepted between an in situ SST location and the location of the central pixel in the\nINSAT extraction box.\nMeasurement quality control: The climatological SST is then calculated for this box by\nspatial averaging and time interpolation. If the absolute value of the difference between\nthe in situ measurement and the climatology is strictly below 20C the box is included into\nthe database.\n5.6.3 Technical issues (limitation etc.)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiative transfer model to\nsimulate the satellite radiances, instrument noise and atmospheric correction. Biases in\nradiative transfer model simulations can be accounted for by validating the derived SST\nwith reliable and concurrent insitu data. In the absence of split thermal window channel\nobservations and a channel sensitive to intervening atmospheric total water vapour\ncontent, the atmospheric correction applied is an indirect. The accuracy of this correction\nwill heavily depend upon the accuracy of the model reanalysis for total water vapour.\nMajor constraints on data quality outside the scope of this effort focus in the following\nareas: accurate pre-launch instrument\ncalibration model performance, availability of quality controlled surface calibration-\nvalidation observations, availability and access to the various quality assessment data sets,\nand timely access to continuing performance assessment data sets. The on-orbit\ninstrument NEÔÇ∂T performance is a primary input to the algorithm error budget.\n5.7 Future Scope\nInitially, prelaunch algorithm would be used to derive SST. Over a period of\napproximately one year, after complete calibration and validation of the product, bias\ncorrection and other fine tuning of the coefficients would be carried out. This should\nimprove the accuracy of the product to the desired level. Of course, instrument noise also\nplays a crucial role in determining the overall accuracy of the product. Generation of\nregression coefficients for SST retrieval from simultaneous satellite and buoy\nobservations data base require nearly 250 buoys distributed over Arabian Sea, Bay of\nBengal and Indian Ocean continuously for minimum 2/3 years.\n5.8 References\n1 Anding D and R Kauth (1970) ‚ÄúEstimation of sea surface temperature from space‚Äù,\nRemote Sensing of Environment, 1, 217-220.\n2 Barton I J (1983) Dual channel satellite measurements of sea surface temperature.\nQuarterly journal of Royal Meteorological Society, 109,365-378.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 96\nSea surface temperature\n3 Coakley J A and F P Bretherton (1982) Cloud cover from high resolution scanner data:\ndetecting and allowing for partially clouded fields of view.

K. Singh Snow Cover Mapping\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nAlgorithms will be developed to map snow cover using INSAT 3D Meteorological payload.\nThe snow mapping algorithm will use a grouped-criteria technique using the Normalized\nDifference Snow Index (NDSI) and other spectral threshold tests to identify snow on a pixel-\nby-pixel basis, and to map snow cover in dense forests. The NDSI is useful for snow\nmapping, as it reflects strongly in the visible region than in the short-wave IR (SWIR) part of\nthe spectrum. In addition, the reflectance of clouds remains high in the short-wave IR, while\nthe reflectance of snow is considerably low.\nValidation of the INSAT snow maps will be carried out using snow products of AWiFS data\nof Resourcesat1/2 and a limited amount of field measurements. In addition, validation will\nalso be carried out using visual interpretation and the MODIS snow maps. The accuracy of\nthe snow maps will vary with land-cover type. Hence, the Snowmap algorithm has been and\nwill continue to be tested for a variety of land covers. Error estimates have been determined\nfrom field measurements for different land covers, and these errors are used to estimate the\nexpected maximum monthly and annual errors in Himalayan snow mapping using the\nalgorithm.\n6.2 Introduction\n6.2.1 Overview and background\nThe purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product\nfrom INSAT 3D data. This algorithm is based on the ratio techniques, which was used\nsuccessfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat-1. Daily snow and 10 days\nsnow covered digital map products will be generated.\nSnow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere\nwinter. This makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation\nbalance (Foster and Chang, 1993). Large areas in the Himalayas are also covered by snow\nduring wintertime. Area of snow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can\naffect stream flow during spring and summer of the rivers originating in the Higher\nHimalayas. In addition, snow pack ablation is highly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase\nin atmospheric temperature can influence snowmelt and stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni, et\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 101\nSnow cover\nal. 2002a). Therefore, mapping of areal extent and reflectance of snow is an important\nparameter for various climatological and hydrological applications. In addition, extent of\nsnow cover can also be used as an input for avalanche investigation.\nSnow was first observed in April 1960 by TIROS-1 satellite in eastern Canada. Since then,\nthe potential for operational satellite-based mapping has been enhanced by the development\nof higher temporal-frequency and satellite sensors with higher spatial resolution. In addition,\nsatellite sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS and AWiFS have been\nused successfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et. al. 2006). This is possibly\ndue to distinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible and short wave infrared\nregion. Information generated from satellite observations has been extensively used for\nsnowmelt runoff modeling (Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing technique has been\nextensively used for snow cover monitoring in the Himalayan region with the help of\nnumerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni and Rathore. 2003). Various analysis techniques as\nvisual, hybrid (Visual and supervised classification) have been used to estimate areal extent\nof snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). However, major difficulty in snow cover\nmonitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan region is mountain shadow and\nconfusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near infrared region. Because of\nabove-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual interpretation technique is\nneeded to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping cumbersome and time\nconsuming. To over come this problem normalized difference snow index method is\ndeveloped and discussed in this paper. In optical region snow reflectance is higher as\ncompared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow\nreflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et. al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on\nsatellite images appears white in visible and black in SWIR region. This characteristic has\nbeen effectively used to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover\nmapping (Hall et al. 1995).\n6.2.1.1 Remote Sensing of Snow Cover\nOne of the earliest method was used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation.\nDuring this investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was\ncarried out using band 2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was\nextensively used for snow cover monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the\nHimalayas (Kulkarni, et. al. 2004).\nThis technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and\navailability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA\nsatellite. In this technique, a combination of visual and digital analysis was used. This was\nnecessary because mountain shadows in the months from November to February normally\nmake it difficult to use only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the month of\nMarch mountain shadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from supervised\nclassification technique. This technique has been extensively used to map snow cover in\nWestern Himalaya, Baspa and Satluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003).\nAnother major difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is further compounded\ndue to similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The discrimination between\nsnow and cloud can be done by using various techniques such as textural analysis,\nassociation with shadow and by using multi temporal analysis. In Himalayas and in present\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 102\nSnow cover\ninvestigation, snow/cloud discrimination was done by using texture, where snow shows\ncharacteristic mountainous pattern, which can not be seen when area is cloud covered. In\nvisible and near infrared region reflectance of snow and cloud is very high. Therefore\ndiscrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. This is because of similar reflectance\ncharacteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-1.75 ÔÅ≠m, 2.1-2.35 ÔÅ≠m and 3.55-\n3.93 ÔÅ≠m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In these bands snow shows\nlower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 ÔÅ≠m has been successfully\nused to separate certain types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et. al., 2006).\nReflectance of fresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but\ndecreases in the near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren\nand Wiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et. al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution\nbecomes incorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance\nsnowmelt (Clarke and Noone, 1985; Negi, et. al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and\nother factors (e.g. soot or volcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over\ntime. Fresh snow can have a reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum)\nup to about 80 percent but its reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow\ncrystals metamorphose.\nSnow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Nolin and Liang, 2000). The\nreflectance from snow is high in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly\nfallen snow can be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the\nspecular component characteristic of forward scattering increases.\n6.2.2 Objective\nThe purpose of the snow-mapping algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow cover product\nfrom INSAT 3D data. This algorithm is based on Normalised Difference Snow Index\nmethod, which was used successfully to monitor snow using AWiFS data of Resourcesat.\nDaily snow and maximum 10-day snow covered area digital-map products will be generated.\nThis algorithm will be further modified, in conjunction with NDVI and infrared brightness\ntemperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively\n(Romanov et al, 2003).\n6.3 Inputs and output data\n6.3.1 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit -- Derived from\ngeometric corrected raw data by\ngray count values DP (data\nVisible (0.52-0.75 ÔÅ≠m) processing)\n& SWIR (1.55-1.70\nÔÅ≠m)\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 103\nSnow cover\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from\ngeometric corrected raw data by\ngray count values of DP\nTIR-1 channel (10.2-\n11.2 ÔÅ≠m)\nGray value to - - 0.3 K Derived by\nbrightness temperature DP\nconversion table\nGeolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by\nDP\n6.3.2 Other Auxillary data and Model Inputs\nSource Product Frequency Role in Purpose\nalgorithm\nAWiFS Land cover map Each Modify NDSI Improve accuracy\nproduct value\nReflectance Reflectance in As per NDSI threshold Development and\nlibrary visible and requirement value before validation of\nSWIR region launch algorithm\nAWiFS/INSAT3A Water mask Each Remove water Improve accuracy\nproduct bodies\n6.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n6.4.1 Overview\nA grouped-criteria technique incorporating NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the\nalgorithm was selected for the following reasons:\n1) Similar algorithm is developed for AWiFS sensor of Resourcesat-1. Its accuracy has\nbeen tested over a variety of surface covers relative to snow cover maps prepared\nfrom other techniques. Similar algorithm is also being used to generate snow maps of\nMODIS data.\n2) The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar\nillumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as\nHimalayas (Kulkarni et. al. 2006).\n3) INSAT 3D Met payloads have a channel between 1.55 to 1.75 ÔÅ≠m with 1 km spatial\nresolution. Similar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel\nnumber 1 and 2 are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be\ngenerated at 1 km resolution.\n4) The algorithm will be further improved using NDVI and brightness temperature to\nidentify snow under forest and cloud, respectively. In addition, Spectral range of band\n1 of INSAT 3 D and AWiFS band 2 are different, threshold values needs to be\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 104\nSnow cover\nevaluated. This will be initially established using Spectral Reflectance library of\nSpace Applications Centre and then sensitivity analysis of INSAT-3D data.\n5) It runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward,\ncomputationally frugal, and thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the\nproduct is generated.\nSnow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The\nNormalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from\nmany other surface features. Both sunlit and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A\nsimilar index for vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been\nproven to be effective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year\n(Tucker, 1979 and 1986). Additionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished\nusing the NDSI.\nOther promising techniques, such as traditional supervised multispectral classifications,\nspectral-mixture modeling, or neural-network analyses have not yet been shown to be\nusable for automatic application at the mountainous region. They are also computationally\nintensive. Training or the interaction of an interpreter is required for successful application\nof techniques such as neural-network analysis. These techniques may progress to regional\napplications and possibly even global application in future years.\n6.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\n6.4.1.1.1 Snow cover map\nThe snow-cover mapping algorithm will be designed to identify snow in each 1 km pixel. A\nregional, daily snow product will be produced. A 10-day composite snow cover product will\nbe generated by compositing successive days of snow cover products. This will yield\nmaximum snow extent for the 10 day period. If a pixel were snow covered on any orbit\nduring that period, then that pixel will be mapped as snow covered even if it were snow-free\non all of the other orbits during the 10-day period. Other coverage and persistence statistics\nwill also be included to assist analysis of the data product.\nThere has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow\nmaps (Kulkarni et. al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the\nNOAA/NESDIS maps and the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer\ncomposition periods, e.g., 7 days to one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this\nperiod optimizes the ground coverage from the MODIS instrument. In India, the hydrological\ndata analysis is carried out on 10-daily basis; therefore 10-day composite will be prepared. If\na researcher wants to produce a composite product for any period other than a 10-day period,\nfrom our daily product, this can be done using the daily data.\n6.4.1.1.2 Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)\nThe NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus\nclouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance\ndifference between the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is\ninsensitive to a wide range of illumination conditions (Kulkarni et al., 2006). The NDSI is\nanalogous to the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986;\nTownshend and Tucker, 1984). NDSI can be computed as given below;\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 105\nSnow cover\nNDSI = (Visible - SWIR ) / (Visible + SWIR )\nINSAT B1 INSAT B2 INSAT B1 INSAT B2\nPixels that are approximately 75% or greater covered by snow were found to have NDSI\nvalues more than 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi\net. al., 2006). These NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous\nAWiFS scenes, comparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique.\n(Kulkarni et. al, 2004). Pure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are\nmixed in a pixel. Snow in mixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure\nsnow can be distinguished by its high NDSI value (Negi et. al., 2006). Since Bandwidth of\nAWiFS band 1 and INSAT 3D imager is different, initially NDSI threshold value will be\nestablished using Field Spectral Data Library of Space Applications Centre (Singh, et. al.,\n2005 and Negi, et. al., 2006). This will be further evaluated during post launch period, by\ncarrying out sensitivity analysis (Kulkarni et. al. 2006).\nIn forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly\nclassify these forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (Negi et. al.,\n2006). NDVI and NDSI will be used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and\nsnow covered forests. Forested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested\npixels. Thus by using the NDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI\nthreshold in forested areas without compromising the algorithm performance for other land\ncovers. Since appropriate bands are not available in INSAT 3D payload, mask will be\ngenerated using AWiFS sensor.\nThe NDSI-NDVI field is designed to capture as much of the variation in NDSI-NDVI values\nobserved in the snow covered forests as possible while minimizing inclusion of non-forested\npixels. It was designed to include forest-covered pixels that have NDSI values lower than 0.4,\nyet have NDVI values lower than would be expected for snow-free conditions (Klein et al.,\n1998).\nSince water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to separate\nwater from snow.\n6.4.1.1.3 Snow / Cloud Discrimination\nSnow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow\nreflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by\ntheir generally high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic\nspectrum (Kulkarni et al, 2002), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave\ninfrared part of the spectrum.\nWhile the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify\nor discriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data\nshow that NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. Cirrus clouds\nhave high reflectance in SWIR region than snow which requires fine tuning of threshold\nvalue and will be used as an additional criterion in present approach. This algorithm will\nfurther be improved due to availability of thermal bands in INSAT 3D Met payload.\nAppropriate brightness temperature threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow\n(Romanov, et. al., 2003) or cloud removal will also be tested using cloud mask product\nsubject to its availability as an additional INSAT 3D derived product. This will be additional\ncriteria than in build criteria of NDSI.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 106\nSnow cover\n6.4.1.1.4 Flow Chart\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 107\nSnow cover\n6.4.1.1.5 Sensitivity analysis to establish NDSI threshold\nIn order to establish credible threshold value of NDSI for snow cover mapping, a sensitivity\ntest of individual threshold values were carried out. NDSI threshold values were changed\nfrom 0 to 1 at an interval of 0.05. If pixel is having NDSI value equal or more than threshold\nvalue then it is classified as snow. Then loss in areal extent due to increase in threshold value\nare converted into percent and plotted on Y-axis . X-axis indicate NDSI threshold. In general,\nareal extent decreases as NDSI value increases from 0 to 1. But amount of change varies\nfrom constant to rapid. In case of AWiFS scene of winter, constant drop in area in the order\nof 3% was observed as threshold value changes from 0 to 0.4. After threshold of 0.4 drop in\narea (Snow pixels) is moderate to rapid. Visual analysis suggests that all snow cover areas\nincluding snow in forest and mountain shadow can be mapped if threshold value is 0.4. In\norder to establish validity of this observation, the similar investigations were carried out from\nDecember to May at an interval of one month.

In addition, comparisons will be made between MODIS maps. Comparison of\nSnowmap results with these independently-produced snow data sets will allow errors to be\nidentified that will permit us to determine the accuracy of the global maps relative to one\nanother. There are several hemispheric-scale satellite-derived snow-cover maps available, but\nnone has been fully validated.\n6.6.1.2. Mapping Snow in Densely-Forested Areas\nA significant limitation in mapping the extent of snow cover occurs in situations of mixed\npixels where snow cover is obscured by dense forest cover. The snow covered forested\nlandscape is actually never completely snow covered because the tree branches, trunks and\ncanopies often do not get or stay snow covered. Often, in boreal forests, snow that falls on\nthe coniferous tree canopy will not stay on the canopy for the entire winter due to\nsublimation. Thus, even in a continuously snow covered area, much of the forested landscape\nwill not be snow covered. It may be very difficult, even with field measurements and high-\nresolution air photos, to determine what percentage of the area is snow covered. Additionally,\nwhen viewing at off-nadir angles the tree branches, canopies, etc., will obscure even more of\nthe snow than when viewing at near-nadir angles.\nDense forests cover much of the Earth‚Äôs land surface. Snow accumulates to greater depths\nand melts later in the spring in the boreal forests than in adjacent areas (Foster et al., 1991).\nThough the boreal forests are always snow covered in the winter, within dense forests, snow\nthat falls onto the ground through the canopy may not be visible from above. Some snow\nstays in the tree canopy and may thus be visible, but the snow often does not stay in the\ncanopy during the entire winter. Snow in trees often sublimates before falling to the ground.\nTherefore, NDSI values will be appropriately modified to identify snow under forest cover.\n6.6.2 Estimate of Errors in Snow cover Mapping\nIt is recognized that NDSI will perform better in some land covers than in others. Specifically,\nresults using the NDSI algorithm with AWiFS data above snow line show 100 percent snow\ncover when they were known by field measurements to be 100 percent snow covered. In\nforested areas, errors may be much larger.\nAn estimate of the errors inherent in using Snow cover map in different land covers will be\nmade using data from focused field missions, for example: agricultural (e.g. in the Kullu\ndistrict.), forest free (e.g. Lahaul and Spiti district of Himachal Pradesh), forest (e.g. Forested\nregion of Beas basin), Errors have been determined for the following land covers: forests,\nmixed agriculture and forest, barren/sparsely-vegetated, shrub land, wetlands, and glacial\nregion. These land covers were selected because they cover a wide range of conditions\nencountered in snow covered parts of the Himalaya.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 109\nSnow cover\n6.7 Future Scope\nThis algorithm will be further modified, in conjunction with NDVI and infrared brightness\ntemperature to identify snow in forest covers and identify cloud pixels, respectively.\n6.8 References\n1) Clarke, A.D. and K.J.

Since\nHimalayan region is highly mountainous, the data processing would initially need calibration,\ngeoreferencing, atmospheric correction, snow pixel detection, cloud masking, local\nillumination angle correction, diffuse radiation correction, BDRF correction and\northorectification. This will be followed by Linear or non-linear mixing modeling to\nestimate snow fraction in each pixel. The mixing modeling would need large spectral\nreflectance library of snow and other land features of Himalayan region, to identify end\nmembers of snow and snow free terrain.\nNext important step in the investigation is to develop a relationship between snow fraction\nand depth. This would need field snow depth data. In North America this relationship was\ndeveloped using 1400 field observatories. Relationship was found useful; if snow depth is\nless than 27 cm. Field data needs to be collected from Indian Meteorological Department.\n7.2 Introduction\n7.2.1 Overview and background\nThe purpose of the snow-depth estimation algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow depth\nproduct from INSAT 3D data. The algorithm based on correlation between depth of the snow\npack and satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004).\nHowever, this relationship was developed for non-forested, open prairie (plain terrain) region\nof North America. The accuracy of snow depth retrievals was found 30% of observed snow\ndepth for snow depth below 30 cm. The satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover is\nindependent of snow depth, if snow depth is more than 30 cm (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004).\nSnow covers almost 40 per cent of the Earth's land surface during Northern Hemisphere\nwinter. This makes snow albedo and area an important component of the Earth's radiation\nbalance (Foster and Chang, 1993). Large areas in the Himalayas are also covered by snow\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 115\nSnow depth\nduring wintertime. Area of snow can change significantly during winter and spring. This can\naffect stream flow during spring and summer of the rivers originating in the Higher\nHimalayas. In order to make optimum utilization of snow information for hydrological,\nclimatological and disaster purpose, snow depth is an important parameter. In addition, snow\npack ablation is highly sensitive to climatic variation. Increase in atmospheric temperature\ncan influence snowmelt and stream runoff pattern (Kulkarni, et al. 2002a).\nTherefore, mapping of areal extent and reflectance of snow is an important parameter for\nvarious climatological and hydrological applications. In addition, extent of snow cover can\nalso be used as an input for avalanche investigation.\nSnow was first observed by satellite in eastern Canada from the TIROS-1 satellite in April\n1960. Since then, the potential for operational satellite-based mapping has been enhanced by\nthe development of higher temporal-frequency and satellite sensors with higher spatial\nresolution. In addition, satellite sensors with better radiometric resolutions, such as MODIS\nand AWiFS have been used successfully for snow mapping (Hall et al. 2002; Kulkarni et. al.\n2006). This is possibly due to distinct spectral reflectance characteristics of snow in visible\nand short wave infrared region. Information generated from satellite observations has been\nextensively used for snowmelt runoff modeling (Kulkarni et al. 2002b). Remote sensing\ntechnique has been extensively used for snow cover monitoring in the Himalayan region with\nthe help of numerous satellite sensors (Kulkarni and Rathore. 2003). Various analysis\ntechniques as visual, hybrid (Visual and supervised classification) have been used to estimate\nareal extent of snow cover (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003). However, major difficulty in snow\ncover monitoring using automated technique in the Himalayan region is mountain shadow\nand confusing signature of snow and cloud in the visible and near infrared region. Because of\nabove-mentioned reasons, combination of digital and visual interpretation technique is\nneeded to monitor snow cover. This makes snow cover mapping cumbersome and time\nconsuming. To over come this problem normalized difference snow index method is\ndeveloped and discussed in this paper. In optical region snow reflectance is higher as\ncompared to other land features as grass, rock and water. However, in SWIR region snow\nreflectance is lower than rock and vegetation (Kulkarni et. al. 2002c). Therefore, snow on\nsatellite images appears white in visible and black in SWIR region. This characteristic can\nbe effectively used to develop Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) for snow cover\nmapping (Hall et al. 1995).\n7.2.1.1 Remote Sensing of Snow Cover and Depth\nOne of the earliest method was used for snow cover monitoring was visual interpretation.\nDuring this investigation Large Format Optical Enlarger was used and investigation was\ncarried out using band 2 of Landsat MSS and IRS LISS-I sensor. The investigation was\nextensively used for snow cover monitoring in Malan, Tosh and many small basins in the\nHimalayas (Kulkarni, et. al. 2004).\nThis technique was further modified with advancement of Digital Analysis Technique and\navailability of higher frequency satellite data such as WiFS of IRS and VHRR of NOAA\nsatellite. In this technique combination of visual and digital analysis technique was used.\nThis was necessary because mountain shadows in the months from November to February\nnormally make it difficult to used only digital technique for snow cover delineation. From the\nmonth of March mountain shadows are negligible and snow extent can be estimated from\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 116\nSnow depth\nsupervised classification technique. This technique has been extensively used to map snow\ncover in Western Himalaya, Baspa and Satluj basins (Kulkarni and Rathore, 2003).\nAnother important difficulty in snow cover monitoring is cloud cover. It is\nfurther compounded due to similar reflectance characteristics of snow and cloud. The\ndiscrimination between snow and cloud can be done by using various techniques such as\ntextural analysis, association with shadow and by using multi temporal analysis. In\nHimalayas and in present investigation, snow/cloud discrimination was done by using texture,\nwhere snow shows characteristic mountainous pattern and it can not be seen, when area is\ncovered by cloud cover. In visible and near infrared region reflectance of snow and cloud is\nvery high. Therefore discrimination between snow and cloud is not possible. This is because\nof similar reflectance characteristics in this region. In spectral range between 1.55-1.75 m,\n2.1-2.35 m and 3.55-3.93 m have shown potential for snow/cloud discrimination. In\nthese bands snow shows lower reflectance than cloud. Spectral region between 1.55-1.75 ÔÅ≠m\nhas been successfully used to separate some types of clouds from snow (Kulkarni et. al.,\n2006).\n7.2.1.2 Estimation of Snow Reflectance in Himalaya\nIn order to estimate snow fraction important step is estimation of reflectance. Reflectance of\nfresh snow is very high in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but decreases in\nthe near-IR especially as grain size increases (O'Brien and Munis, 1975; Warren and\nWiscombe, 1980; Srinivasulu et. al. 2002). In addition, soot from industrial pollution\nbecomes incorporated into the snowpack and this may decrease albedo and enhance\nsnowmelt (Clarke and Noone, 1985; Negi, et. al. 2006). Both because of natural aging and\nother factors (e.g. soot or volcanic ash deposition), the reflectance of snow decreases over\ntime. Fresh snow can have a reflectance (integrated over the reflective part of the spectrum)\nup to about 80 percent but its reflectance may decrease to below 40 percent after snow\ncrystals metamorphose.\nOne of the parameter, which can influence satellite obtained reflectance is terrain topography.\nThe relative magnitudes of terrain slope and its aspect with respect to the sun's position will\ndetermine the amount of direct solar radiation incident on an undulating surface. The analysis\ncarried out over the Beas Basin, Himachal Pradesh, India, indicated a variation of 22% in the\namount of incident solar radiation for an increase of 10ÔÇ∞ in terrain slope (Srinivasulu and\nKulkarni, 2003).\nVarious parameters required to estimate reflectance are mean solar exo-atmospheric spectral\nirradiances in the sensor bands, digital elevation information, solar declination, mean earth-\nsun distance on a Julian day, and the calibration parameters of the sensor, such as maximum\nand minimum radiances in the sensor bands. The terrain topography parameters, viz., terrain\nslope and aspect are derived from the digital elevation information of the terrain. The local\nillumination angle for each pixel, which determines the amount of direct solar radiation\nincident on a sloped surface, is computed using both the sun and terrain geometry.\nMarkham and Barker equation for computing reflectance from a flat area cannot be valid for\nthe Himalayan region where the terrain is highly undulating. To estimate reflectance from a\nrugged terrain, cosine of the local illumination angle, not the cosine of solar zenith angle, has\nto be used as given below:\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 117\nSnow depth\nÔÅ≤ = ÔÅ∞ L d2 / E cosÔÅ±\nÔÅ¨ ÔÅ¨ sunÔÅ¨ i\nWhere, d is the mean earth-sun distance on a Julian day (AU), and ÔÅ± is the local illumination\ni\nangle (degree), the angle between the Sun's rays and the surface normal and is calculated by\nusing the relation given by Robinson (1966).\nSnow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Salomonson and Marlatt, 1968;\nDirmhirn and Eaton, 1975; Steffen, 1987; Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance from\nsnow is greatest in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow\ncan be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular\ncomponent characteristic of forward scattering increases. This means, reflectance of snow\nwill change depending upon view and illumination geometry. This can be described by\nBidirectional reflectance distribution Function (BRDF) (George Joseph, 2005).\n7.2.2 Objective\nThe purpose of the snow-depth estimation algorithm is to generate Himalayan snow depth\nproduct from INSAT 3D data. The algorithm based on correlation between depth of the snow\npack and satellite derived sub pixel fractional snow cover (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004).\nHowever, this relationship was developed for non-forested, open prairie (plain terrain) region\nof North America. Therefore, this algorithm needs further development for application in\nmountainous Himalayan Terrain. This involves reflectance correction using local\nillumination angle, diffuse radiation from sidewalls and Bidirectional reflectance distribution\nFunction (BRDF). BRDF is necessary as snow reflectance in anisotropic with aging.\n7.3 Inputs\n7.3.1 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit -- Derived from\ngeometric raw data by\ncorrected gray DP (data\ncount values processing)\nVisible (0.52-0.75\nÔÅ≠m) & SWIR\n(1.55-1.70 ÔÅ≠m)\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from\ngeometric raw data by\ncorrected gray DP\ncount values of\nTIR-1 channel\n(10.2-11.2 ÔÅ≠m)\nGray value to - - 0.3 K Derived by\nbrightness DP\ntemperature\nconversion table\nGeolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by\nDP\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 118\nSnow depth\n7.3.2 Other Auxillary data and Model Inputs\nSource Product Role in algorithm Purpose\nField Data Snow Depth Development of Developing and\nSnow fraction and validating.\nsnow depth based\napproach\nSensor parameter Sun-solar geometry Deriving snow Generation of snow\nfraction map cover map\nTopographic map Digital Elevation Terrain parameters Computation of\nModel Slope and aspect of\nterrain.\nAOD, O3, and Transmittance Atmospheric To minimize\nother gases coefficient correction atmospheric\ncontribution\nAWiFS Land cover map Modify NDSI value Improve accuracy\nReflectance library Reflectance in NDSI threshold Development and\nvisible and SWIR value before launce validation of\nregion algorithm\nAWiFS Water mask Remove water Improve accuracy\nbodies\n7.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n7.4.1 Overview\nFirst step in this study is estimation of snow pixels. A grouped-criteria technique\nincorporating a NDSI and threshold-based criterion for the algorithm will be used due to the\nfollowing reasons:\n1) Similar algorithm is developed for AWiFS sensor of Resourcesat. Its accuracy has\nbeen tested over a variety of surface covers relative to snow cover maps prepared\nfrom other techniques. Similar algorithm is also being used to generate snow maps\nusing MODIS data.\n2) The technique can map snow under mountain shadow and independent of local solar\nillumination angle. It makes this algorithm highly suitable for mountainous terrain as\nHimalayas.\n3) INSAT 3D Met payloads have a channel between 1.55 to 1.75 ÔÅ≠m with 1 km spatial\nresolution. Similar channel is not available on GOES satellite. In addition, channel\nnumber 1 and 2 are having 1 km spatial resolution. Therefore, product can be\ngenerated at 1 km resolution.\n4) It runs automatically, without human intervention. It is straightforward,\ncomputationally frugal, and thus easy for the user to understand exactly how the\nproduct is generated.\nSnow has strong visible reflectance and strong short-wave IR absorbing characteristics. The\nNormalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) is an effective way to distinguish snow from\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 119\nSnow depth\nmany other surface features. Both sunlit and some shadowed snow is mapped effectively. A\nsimilar index for vegetation, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been\nproven to be effective for monitoring global vegetation conditions throughout the year\n(Tucker, 1979 and 1986). Additionally, some snow/cloud discrimination is accomplished\nusing the NDSI.\nOther promising techniques, such as traditional supervised multispectral classifications,\nspectral-mixture modeling, or neural-network analyses have not yet been shown to be usable\nfor automatic application at the global scale. They are also computationally intensive.\nTraining or the interaction of an interpreter is required for successful application of\ntechniques such as neural-network analysis. These techniques may progress to regional\napplications and possibly even global application in future years.\n7.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\n7.4.1.1.1 Identification of Snow pixels\nThe snow-cover mapping algorithm will be designed to identify snow in each 1 km pixel. A\nregional, daily snow product will be produced. An 10-day composited snow cover product\nwill be generated by compositing successive days of snow cover products. This will yield\nmaximum snow extent for the 10 day period. If a pixel were snow covered on any orbit\nduring that period, then that pixel will be mapped as snow covered even if it were snow-free\non all of the other orbits during the 10-day period. Other coverage and persistence statistics\nwill also be included to assist analysis of the data product.\nThere has been much discussion concerning the optimum composite period for the snow\nmaps (Kulkarni et. al, 2006). While weekly composites would correspond with the\nNOAA/NESDIS maps and the NOHRSC maps, some modelers are interested in longer\ncomposition periods, e.g., 7 days to one month. 8-day composites were chosen because this\nperiod optimizes the ground coverage from the MODIS instrument. The repeat period of the\nsatellite is 16 days. In India, the hydrological data analysis is carried out on 10-daily basis;\ntherefore 10-day composite will be prepared. If a researcher wants to produce a composite\nproduct for any period other than a 10-day period, from our daily product, this can be done\nusing the daily data.\n7.4.1.1.2 Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI)\nThe NDSI is useful for the identification of snow and for separating snow and most cumulus\nclouds. The NDSI is a measure of the relative magnitude of the characteristic reflectance\ndifference between the visible and short-wave IR reflectance of snow. The NDSI is\ninsensitive to a wide range of illumination conditions, is partially normalized for atmospheric\neffects, and does not depend on reflectance in a single band (Kulkarni 2006). The NDSI is\nanalogous to the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker, 1979 and 1986;\nTownshend and Tucker, 1984).\nNDSI = (INSAT Band 1 - INSAT Band 2) / (INSAT Band 1 + INSAT Band 2)\nPixels that are approximately 25 % or greater covered by snow have been found to have\nNDSI values 0.4 in our field investigation at Dhundi test site in Himachal Pradesh (Negi et.\nal., 2006). Since water may also have an NDSI 0.4, therefore permanent mask is necessary to\nseparate water from snow.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 120\nSnow depth\nThese NDSI thresholds have been verified from detailed analysis of numerous AWiFS scenes,\ncomparisons with supervised-classification techniques and NDSI technique. (Kulkarni et. al.\n2004). Pure snow has a high NDSI but NDSI decreases as other features are mixed in a pixel.\nSnow in mixed pixels has an NDSI that is less than that for pure snow. Pure snow can be\ndistinguished by its high NDSI value (Negi et. al., 2006).\nIn forested locations, many snow covered pixels have an NDSI lower than 0.4. To correctly\nclassify these forests as snow covered, a lower NDSI threshold is necessary (negi et. al.,\n2006; Hall et al, 1998). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the NDSI\nare used together in order to discriminate between snow-free and snow covered forests.\nForested pixels have higher NDVI values compared with non-forested pixels. Thus by using\nthe NDSI and NDVI in combination, it is possible to lower the NDSI threshold in forested\nareas without compromising the algorithm performance in other land covers. Since\nappropriate bands are not available in INSAT 3D payload, mask will be generated using\nAWiFS sensor.\nThe NDSI-NDVI field is designed to capture as much of the variation in NDSI-NDVI values\nobserved in the snow covered forests as possible while minimizing inclusion of non-forested\npixels. It was designed to include forest-covered pixels that have NDSI values lower than 0.4,\nyet have NDVI values lower than would be expected for snow-free conditions (Klein et al.,\n1998).\n7.4.1.1.3 Snow / Cloud Discrimination\nSnow/cloud-discrimination techniques are based on differences between cloud and snow\nreflectance and emittance characteristics. Clouds are highly variable and may be detected by\ntheir generally-high reflectance in the visible and near-IR parts of the electromagnetic\nspectrum (Kulkarni et al, 2002), whereas the reflectance of snow drops in the short-wave\ninfrared part of the spectrum.\nWhile the NDSI can separate snow from most obscuring clouds, it does not always identify\nor discriminate optically-thin cirrus clouds from snow. Analyses of AWiFS and MODIS data\nshow that NDSI can map snow under cirrus clouds at least some of the time. This algorithm\nwill be further improves, as INSAT 3D Met payload is having thermal bands. Appropriate\nbrigtness temperature threshold will be used to separate cloud from snow (Romanov, et. al.,\n2003). This will be additional criteria than in build criteria of NDSI.\n7.4.1.1.4 Estimation of Snow Reflectance\nVarious parameters required to estimate reflectance are mean solar exo-atmospheric spectral\nirradiances in the sensor bands, digital elevation information, solar declination, mean earth-\nsun distance on a Julian day, and the calibration parameters of the sensor, such as maximum\nand minimum radiances in the sensor bands. The terrain topography parameters, viz., terrain\nslope and aspect are derived from the digital elevation information of the terrain. The local\nillumination angle for each pixel, which determines the amount of direct solar radiation\nincident on a sloped surface, is computed using both the sun and terrain geometry.\nMarkham and Barker equation for computing reflectance from a flat area cannot be valid for\nthe Himalayan region where the terrain is highly undulating. To estimate reflectance from a\nrugged terrain, cosine of the local illumination angle, not the cosine of solar zenith angle, has\nto be used as given below:\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 121\nSnow depth\nÔÅ≤ = ÔÅ∞ L d2 / E cosÔÅ±\nÔÅ¨ ÔÅ¨ sunÔÅ¨ i\nWhere, d is the mean earth-sun distance on a Julian day (AU), and ÔÅ± is the local illumination\ni\nangle (degree), the angle between the Sun's rays and the surface normal and is calculated by\nusing the relation given by Robinson (1966).\nSnow, like all natural surfaces, is an anisotropic reflector (Salomonson and Marlatt, 1968;\nDirmhirn and Eaton, 1975; Steffen, 1987; Nolin and Liang, 2000). The reflectance from\nsnow is greatest in the forward direction and is largely specular. While freshly fallen snow\ncan be nearly a Lambertian reflecting surface, as snow metamorphoses the specular\ncomponent characteristic of forward scattering increases. This means, reflectance of snow\nwill change depending upon view and illumination geometry. This can be described by\nBidirectional reflectance distribution Function (BRDF) (George Joseph, 2005).\nF(Œ∏i, √òi, Œ∏r, √òr) = dLr (Œ∏i, √òi, Œ∏r, √òr)/Li cos Œ∏i dwi\nWhere,\nŒòi = Zenith angle of incident ray\n√òi = Azimuth angle of incident ray\nŒòr = Zenith angle of reflected ray\n√òr = Azimuth angle of reflected ray\nLi = Incident radiance\ndLr = Reflected radiance in solid angle\ndwi = Solid angle\n7.4.1.1.5 SNOW FRACTION RETRIEVAL\nTo calculate snow fraction (F), technique similar to a linear mixture technique can be used\n(Romanov and Tarpley, 2004). This techniques need two end members representing the\nvisible reflectance of a completely snow-covered and completely snow-free land surface,\nRsnow and Rland, respectively.\nF = (R-Rland) / (Rsnow-Rland)\nWhere, R is the observed visible reflectance of the scene. The reflectance of snow free land\nin every grid cell of the map will be established from satellite data obtained during snow free\nseason. The reflectance of snow assumed to be independent of location and determined\nempirically from satellite data or from field reflectance observations. Previous investigations\nhave shown that snow fraction retrievals was unreliable over mountainous area due to\nfrequent specular reflectance effects on satellite observed visible reflectance (Romanov and\nTarpley, 2004). Attempt will be made to resolve this problem by using concepts mentioned\nabove as local illumination angle correction, Bidirectional reflectance distribution Function\nand multiple data analysis in a day.\n7.4.1.1.6 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SNOW FRACTION AND DEPTH\nRomanov and Tarpley, (2004) have developed a statistical relationship between satellite\nobserved snow fraction and field observed snow depth. For this purpose field snow depth\ndata of 1400 locations in Great Plains of USA and Canadian Prairies were analyzed. During\nmatching observations, to reduce the effect of possible inhomogeneity of the snow depth\ndistribution and inaccuracy of gecoding, snow fraction was averaged 3 x 3 grid. For\ndevelopment of this technique, forested region was exclude. A statistical relationship was\ndeveloped between snow fraction and depth (Romanov and Tarpley, 2004).\nD = eaF ‚Äì1\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 122\nSnow depth\nWhere, D (cm) is the snow depth, F (%) is the snow fraction and a is a parameter. The best\napproximation of snow fraction and snow depth was achieve with a = 0.0333. This means\n100 percent snow fraction can give snow depth around 27 cm. This could be major limitation\nin the Himalaya, as snow depth is normally very high due orographic effect and avalanche\naccumulation of snow.\nIn order to apply this concept in the Himalaya, daily snow depth data needs to be collected\nfrom IMD and SASE observatories and region specific relationship needs to be developed.\nThis relationship should be developed using historical INSAT, MODIS and snow depth data.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 123\nSnow depth\n7.4.1.2 Flow Chart\nINSAT\nVisible, SWIR and TIR data\nfiles\nWater body Conversion from Grey Calibration Coeff.\ncount to Radiance,\nmasking And Geolocated\nReflectance and BT values\nproduct\nCloud detection\n(Elimination of cloudy pixel\nby threshold in BT of TIR)\nTopographic Atmospheric\nCorrection Correction\nAtmospheric and Topographically\ncorrected reflectance\nSnow Pixel identification\nSnow reflectance\n(NDSI approach)\ndata\nSnow Fraction\nRetrieval\nField depth data\nSnow Depth Estimation\nFigure 1.

The radiometrically-\nprocessed data will also be geolocated and this will provide a radiometrically and\ngeometrically corrected product for further analysis.\n7.4.2.2 Step 2: Cloud elimination\nThis step includes the cloud screening from the INSAT 3D image. Cloud screening is based\non the temperature data and will help to clear cloudy pixels, which possibly are not feasible\nto screen out using visible and SWIR channel based NDSI image.\n7.4.2.3 Step 3: Topographic and Atmospheric correction\nIn this step, DEM data will be used to compute the terrain parameters like slope and aspect of\nthe terrain, which will further be used to compute the local illumination angle. Atmospheric\ncorrection algorithm will be applied to compute the atmospherically corrected radiance and\nreflectance values with standard procedures. This step will provide us the atmospherically\nand topographically corrected radiances and reflectance.\n7.4.2.4 Step 4: Snow pixel identification\nSnow pixel identification will be done by using NDSI based approach which uses the\nnormalized ratio of visible and SWIR wavelength reflectance. This prepares a binary map of\neither snow or non-snow pixels.\n7.4.2.5 Snow fraction retrieval\nFractional snow map will be prepared by using linear mixing approach. This considers land\nand pure snow as end members and compute the snow fraction of any particular pixel using\nreflectance value.\n7.4.2.6 Snow Depth Estimation\nA statistical relationship was developed between snow fraction and depth (Romanov and\nTarpley, 2004). Snow depth will be estimated by using this relationship for each pixel.\n7.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nSD cm - - - 1 x 1 deg\n7.5.1 format of the output and the domain\nGeolocated Snow depth map.\n40 S to 40 N; 30 E to 120 E.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 125\nSnow depth\n7.6 Validation\n7.6.1 Comparison of INSAT 3D snow depth with field observations:\nINSAT-derived snow depth will continue to be compared with snow depth obtained from\nfield locations. Sites, which were used for development of snow depth algorithm, will be\nused during validation, however both the activites will be carried out at different time frame.\n7.6.2 Estimate of Errors in Snow Depth Mapping\nStandard statistical methods will be used to assess error of estimation, as snow depth data is\navailable from field and satellite.\n7.7 Technical issues:\nThe snow depth of this method is limited to 27 cm of snow depth in prairie region which is\nexpected to deteriorate further for highly rugged Himalayan mountain. It is required to\ndevelop the exponential relationship for Himalayan region based on snow depth.\n7.8 Future Scope\nIn future scope the developed statistical relationship of snow depth with fractional snow will\nbe modified for Himalayan region as and when data will be available. Indian Meteorological\nDepartment will provide field data of snow depth and snow fraction.\n7.9 References\n1. Clarke, A.D. and K.J.

Forest fire quite\nfrequently occurs during summer seasons in tropical countries. A study by forest survey\nof India has revealed that 51% of the forest area in Assam and Gujarat, 93% in Arunachal\nPradesh, 67% in Bihar, 69% in Himanchal Pradesh, 46 % in Jammu and Kashmir, 45% in\nKarnataka, 76% in Madhya Pradesh, 94% in Meghalaya and Orissa, 87% in Nagaland,\n58% in Uttar Pradesh and 33% in W. Bengal is subject to annual fires.\nOne of the most important critical elements of the forest fire management system (FFMS)\nin the country is the real time detection onset of fire and it‚Äôs monitoring; study the rate,\ndirection and quantitative estimation of fire spread and amount of smoke emission.\nSatellite data with suitable spectral bands for fire detection (Visible, SWIR, MIR and\nThermal IR bands), daily or twice a day‚Äôs repetivity (day and night) and bare minimum\nspatial resolution, which can locate the fire, can play an important role in development of\ncountry‚Äôs FFMS. Geostationary satellite such as GOES with automated biomass burning\nalgorithm (ABBA) have matured enough for providing information on large-scale forest\nfires on a regular basis (Prins et al, 1992, 1994, 1998). INSAT-3D imager data with 1 km\nresolution in Visible and SWIR bands and 4 km. in MIR and in TIR-I and TIR-II will\nhelp in detecting and monitoring of large scale forest fires, smoke and burn scar.\nThe purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving forest fire areas\nfrom INSAT-3D multi-wavelength thermal radiation measurements in clear skies.\nThe INSAT-3D fire products will be built on the experience of fire assessment using the\nMODIS, NOAA-AVHRR and GOES systems. The fire products will include an\nidentification of the occurrence of thermal anomalies, and an estimate the total emitted\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 131\nFire\nenergy from the fire. The products will be made available at full resolution (4 km) and as\nspatial summaries and temporal composites. Daytime and nighttime fire distributions\nproducts will be identified.\nThe fire products will be developed on the basis of convergence of evidence from\ndifferent spectral information. The INSAT-3D fire products will provide information on\nthe location of a fire, its emitted energy, and an estimate of area burned. The fire products\nwill be made available through IMD as daily 4 km resolution and spatially and\ntemporally summarized products (10 km, and 8 day and monthly), more suited for use by\nthe broader environmental management community as well as modelling community.\n8.2.2 Objective\nThe basic purpose of this document is to propose an algorithm for identifying fire using\nINSAT 3D imager data. This algorithm is supposed to form the basis of real time\napplication of INSAT 3D data in the identification of fire.\n8.3 Inputs\nInputs to the algorithm will include geo-referenced radiant temperature (in deg\nKelvin) for MIR,TIR-I,TIR-II, along with satellite viewing geometry (solar zenith\nangle, satellite zenith angle, azimuth angle). Additionally there is a requirement for\ntemperature data from all IMD-stations, which will help in defining thresholds. Cloud\nand land/sea mask data will also be used. All these inputs are specifically categorised in\nthe following subsections:\n8.3.1 Static Data\nAbout 10 years temperature data from all IMD-stations (as stated in table below),\ninterpolated to geo-referenced raster format (GeoTIFF) at 4x4 km spatial resolution for\nentire India. This will be useful in defining the background temperature for different\ntemperature zones.\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nTemperature Pixel (4x4 10 bit -- Derived from\nkm spatial Temperature\nresolution) data obtained\nfrom IMD\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 132\nFire\n8.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nThe following table gives a list of inputs required for algorithm input and calibration:\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit -- Derived from\ngeometric raw data by\ncorrected gray DP (data\ncount values processing)\nof MIR channel\n(3.9)\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from\ngeometric raw data by\ncorrected gray DP\ncount values\nof TIR-I channel\n(10.5)\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from\ngeometric raw data by\ncorrected gray DP\ncount values\nof TIR-II\nchannel (11.5)\nGray value to - - 0.3 K Derived by\nbrightness DP\ntemperature\n(MIR, TIR-1,\nTIR-2)\nconversion table\nGeolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by\nDP\n8.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\nThe INSAT-3D fire detection and characterization techniques are planned to be fully\nautomated for the production of daily fire information at country level. In order to detect\nthe presence of fire in a non-interactive fashion, a set of detection multiband thresholding\ncriteria different for the day and night fire observations are prescribed. These criteria are\nbased on the apparent temperature of the fire pixel and the difference between the fire\npixel and its background temperature. In this section we describe the theoretical basis and\nalgorithm overview for identification of fire.\n8.4.1 Overview\n8.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\nÔÇ∑ Any object above absolute zero ( 0 K; -273.16o C; -459.69o F) emits EMR.\nÔÇ∑ As temp. increases the maxima shifts towards shorter wave length.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 133\nFire\nÔÇ∑ Œªmax=2897/T ; ¬µm (Wien‚Äôs displacement law) can give max. W.L. at\nwhich the exitance is maximum & is related to Temp. (e,g, Œªmax=9.66 ¬µ at\n300o K)\nINSAT MIR Channel (3.70 to 3.95¬µm) is located near the spectral maximum for\nradiative emission for objects radiating at temperature around 400 to 1200 K. this\ntemperature is closed to the temperature of burning forest biomass. INSAT, TIR-I\nChannel (10.20¬µm ‚Äì 11.30¬µm) and TIR-II (11.5¬µm to 12.5¬µm) are located near the\nspectral maxima for normal environment temperature i.e. around 300 K (fig.1).\nTherefore, both these channels will be useful in fire detection algorithms.\nIN-ch3 IN-ch5\nIN-ch6\n3 CO2 8 O3 CO2 14\nAtm. window\nFigure.1.

Pixel will be flagged as\ncontaining fire if the values of its brightness temperature and or reflectance exceeds or\nfalls below certain predetermined threshold values, which are fixed during development\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 134\nFire\nphase. Visible and SWIR bands will be utilized for masking clouds and water bodies.\nContextual Algorithm (Giglio, et al., 1999: and Kaufman, et al., 1998) is proposed at this\nstage.\nA fire location represents the approximate location of the fire pixels and do not represent\nthe actual fire size, which is usually much smaller than pixel size (4 km.). The INSAT at\nNadir is 4x4 Km, for MIR and TIR, which is quite large, but the fire phenomenon is\nusually much smaller than that. Studies at Cooperative Institute of Meteorological\nSatellite Studies (CIMSS) at the University of Wisconsin have shown that the sub ‚Äì\nsatellite point, and smoldering at 450 K, in case of GOES (IFOV: 4x4Km) is\napproximately 0.5 to 1 acre in size in relatively non-cloudy conditions.\nRobinson (1991) has shown that due to very high amplification over background at 3.7\n¬µm for forest fires occupying even a small fraction of a percent of an AVHRR pixel can\nsubstantially increase the mid IR brightness of the entire pixel. Therefore, fire (active\nfire) can be monitored at very low spatial resolution.\n8.4.1.2 Algorithm Overview\nThe fire detection algorithm proposed here employs multi-thresholding contextual\ntechnique, which includes multi band thresholds, and compares with the background. The\nalgorithm will first masks out ocean, desert, water and cloud pixels and then proceed\nfurther. The contextual algorithms identify a fire pixel based on the level of contrast\nbetween the potential fire pixel and its ‚Äúbackground‚Äù pixels (the definition of background\nvaries according to kernel size). As opposed to the fixed threshold techniques, which\nmust be defined for given regions and seasons, the contextual algorithm is supposed to be\nflexible and effective in different environmental conditions. Potential fire pixels will be\nidentified using a less restrictive version of the threshold algorithm. These threshold\nvalues will be determined through visual inspection of known fire/non-fire pixels. An\ninitial threshold reduces the number of candidate pixels to be applied to the contextual\nalgorithm. The contextual algorithm is based on detecting the contrast between a pixel\nand its background. A pixel‚Äôs background can be defined as the 15x15 window\nsurrounding the subject pixel. Because of the large areal extent of many interior Indian\nwildfires, it is necessary to have such a large window size to define the background\nvalues. If a background window size is too small (for example, 3x3), there is a good\nchance that large wildfires occupying several pixels will elevate the background values\nrendering the fire undetectable.\nThe algorithm is a three-step process:\nFirst, the temperatures of channels 3, 5, & 6 of INSAT-3D from pixels adjacent to the\ntest pixel will be averaged; these values will be utilized in a separate algorithm to\nestimate background temperature and adjusted temperature values for channels 3 & 5.\nSecond, a user-defined minimum fire temperature of interest will be specified.\nThird, if the adjusted temperature value for channel 3 is greater than the threshold\nchannel 3 temperature, the pixel is classified as fire. The fire identification algorithm\nflowchart is given in next subsection:\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 135\nFire\n8.4.1.3 Flow Chart\nRadiant Temp.\nPredicted NO T3> T3> NO Predicted\nNon-fire 309 K 290 K Non-fire\nCloud Mask\nYES YES\nPredicted NO T5> Day Night T5> NO Predicted\nNon-fire 286 K 273 K Non-fire\nYES YES\nWhere, ¬µ = mean Predicted NO T3-T5 >= YES\nNon-fire 10 K T3 > ¬µ3 + NO Predicted\nœÉ = S.D. of the Apply (1.5) * œÉ3 Non-fire\ncontextual\n15x15-pixel window\nsurrounding the\ncandidate pixel YES\nPredicted YES T3-T5 > NO Predicted\nFire Pixel ¬µ3-5 + Non-fire\n(1.5 * œÉ3-5)\nFigure.2.

It is formed by combustion or other chemical processes. Each year\nmore than 100 million tons of smoke aerosols are released into the atmosphere as a result of\nbiomass burning. More than 80percent of this burning is in the tropical regions [1]. Smoke\nplumes can travel over hundreds or even thousands of kilometers horizontally and also reach\nup to stratosphere under certain atmospheric circulation conditions. Thus smoke can have an\nimpact far beyond the region of fire activity. Smoke play a major role on the radiation\nbalance of the earth-atmosphere system. Smoke particles scatter and absorb incoming solar\nradiation, thereby having a two-fold impact, i.e. a cooling effect at the surface, but warming\neffect on the atmosphere. Since the magnitude of the scattering effect outweighs that of\nabsorption, smoke has a net cooling effect at the top of the atmosphere-surface system. This\nis often called the direct effect of smoke aerosols [1].\nSmoke can also modify the short wave reflective properties of clouds by acting as cloud\ncondensation nuclei [2]. Under a limited supply of water vapor, an increased number of\nnuclei result in smaller cloud droplets that have higher reflectivity than larger cloud\ndroplets .This effect called the indirect radiative forcing, is difficult to quantify and has large\nuncertainties associated with the sign and magnitudes.\nUnderstanding such numerous and complex effects of smoke on weather and climate requires\na good knowledge of the spatial and temporal variation of smoke and its optical properties,\nwhich is only feasible by means of satellite observation. Identification of smoke on satellite\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 141\nSmoke\nimagery is a prerequisite to study and retrieve physical, chemical, and optical properties of\nsmoke.\n9.2.2 Objective\nThe basic purpose of this document is to propose an algorithm for identifying smoke using\nINSAT 3D imager data. This algorithm is supposed to form the basis of real time application\nof INSAT 3D data in the identification of smoke.\n9.3 Inputs\nInputs to the algorithm will include geo-referenced, corrected Albedo, Digital counts for\nVisible channel and geo-referenced Brightness temperature for MIR,TIR1, TIR2, along with\nsatellite viewing geometry (solar zenith angle, satellite zenith angle, azimuth angle).\nAdditionally there is a requirement for dataset of forest fires acquired over India for defining\nthresholds.\nAll these inputs are specifically categorized in the following subsections.\n9.3.1 Static Data\nRadiometric and geometric corrected dataset of forest fires acquired over Indian region for\nthe channels of corresponding INSAT-3D channels (given in table below) of MODIS sensor.\nTable 2: STATIC DATA\nChannel Channel Central\nNumber Number wavelength\n(MODIS) (INSAT3D) (Œºm)\n1 1 0.65\n21 3 4.0\n22 3 4.0\n31 5 11.0\n32 6 12.0\n9.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nThe following table gives a list of inputs required for algorithm input and calibration:\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 142\nSmoke\nTable 3: IMAGE AND CALIBRATION INPUTS\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and\nDerived from\ngeometric corrected\nraw data by\ngray count values pixel 10 bit --\nDP (data\nof VIS channel\nprocessing)\n(6.5)\nRadiometric and\nDerived from\ngeometric corrected\nraw data by\ngray count values pixel 10 bit --\nDP (data\nof MIR channel\nprocessing)\n(3.9)\nRadiometric and\ngeometric corrected Derived from\ngray count values pixel 10 bit - raw data by\nof TIR-I channel DP\n(10.5)\nRadiometric and\ngeometric corrected Derived from\ngray count values pixel 10 bit - raw data by\nof TIR-II channel DP\n(11.5)\nGray value to\nbrightness\ntemperature (MIR, Derived by\n- - 0.3 K\nTIR-1, DP\nTIR-2) conversion\ntable\nGray value to\nDerived by\nalbedo (VIS) - - 0.3 K\nDP\nconversion table\nDerived by\nGeolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel\nDP\n9.3.3 Other Auxillary data and Model Inputs\nTable 4: AUXILARY DATA\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nDerived by\nSolar Zenith Angle pixel - --\nDP\nSatellite Zenith Derived by\npixel - --\nAngle DP\nDerived by\nAzimuth angle pixel - -\nDP\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 143\nSmoke\n9.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\nAutomatic detection of smoke pixels in a satellite imagery calls for development of algorithm\nemploying multi-thresholding techniques and utilizing multi-band satellite data. In this\nsection we describe the theoretical basis and algorithm overview for identification of smoke.\n9.4.1 Overview\n9.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\nIdentification of smoke through satellite observations is a challenge in itself. The large\nspectral overlap in the spectral signature smoke and other scene types such as clouds and\nbackground surfaces has complicated the problem. Till date, very few studies have been done\nto discriminate smoke in a satellite imagery. The most commonly used method of identifying\nsmoke is to assign different colors to different channels or channel combinations. The\nresulting false-color images can provide visual separation of smoke from other objects. For\nexample, Kaufman et al. [2] assigned AVHRR channel 1 to red, channel 2 to green, and\ninverse channel 4 to blue, generating a composite image showing smoke plumes [3]. The\nHazard Mapping System (HMS) developed in 2001 by the National Oceanic and\nAtmospheric Administrations (NOAA) National Environmental Satellite and Data\nInformation Service (NESDIS) also generated the smoke outlines manually, primarily\nutilizing animated visible band satellite imagery.\nSmoke plumes and their path can also be traced using temporal satellite imagery, through\nimage processing techniques. But this methodology is a manual detection technique and can\nhardly be used for automatic detection of smoke in satellite imageries. Some sporadic efforts\nin the direction of distinguishing smoke in satellite imagery has been made in the past. The\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES-8 employed the automated smoke/\naerosol detection algorithm (ASADA) to monitor biomass burning in South America [4],\nwhile some attempts for automatic detection of smoke using artificial neural networks and\nthreshold approaches applied to AVHRR imagery was made by Li et al [3]\nIn general, smoke is composed of many small particles suspended in the air. These particles\nscatter and absorb (attenuate) different spectra of electromagnetic radiation. This absorption\nreduces transmittance of that radiation through the smoke. The effect of smoke aerosol as\nfunction of wavelength forms the crux of its satellite detection algorithm. Smoke has a large\neffect in the visible part of the spectrum, decreasing in magnitude with wavelength from the\nblue to the red region. In the near IR the effect is smaller than the variation in the surface\nreflectance between the smoke free area and the area affected by smoke. The smoke effect is\nnot observable in the mid IR (2.2 ¬µm) region due to the large ratio of the wavelength of\nradiation to the size of particles.\nThus using visible channel it is possible to distinguish smoke plumes over land. But the\ndiffusion processes associated with smoke and clouds lead to fuzzy boundaries between them.\nHence although the reflectance of smoke is generally less than that of clouds, the latter has so\nlarge a range of variation that it is difficult to use it to discriminate smoke pixels from cloudy\npixels. Thus the biggest challenge in smoke detection is to isolate smoke from a smoke/\nHaze/ Cloud mix in a satellite imagery. Discrimination between smoke and clouds is\ngenerally made on the basis of cloud classification.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 144\nSmoke\nThe channels Visible, MIR, TIR-1, TIR-2 of the INSAT-3D imager exhibit some distinction\nin the characteristics of smoke, clouds and underlying surface which is the basis of smoke\nidentification.\nAlgorithm Overview\nThe smoke detection algorithm proposed here employs multi-thresholding technique, which\nincludes single and multi band difference thresholds, corrected albedo calculations, sun glint\nmask and cloud edge detection. It first eliminates Smoke/ Cloud/ Haze free pixels and then\nscreens out different kinds of cloudy pixels to arrive at smoke pixels. In general, the\nreflectance and brightness temperature of dense smoke have intermediate values between\nthose of clouds and land. The reflectance of smoke is usually less than that of clouds, but\nhigher than that of the underlying surface, while the converse is true for brightness\ntemperature So double sided thresholding is applied in form of these five pass tests.\nFirst pass Test:\nA first pass thresholding is done on the visible channel counts to limit values indicative of\nhaze/cloud mix.\nSecond pass Test:\nSecond pass is albedo thresholding to further screen out cloud/ surface reflectance over\nland and water.\nAlbedo Calculation for the VIS channel\nis the solar zenith angle and F is the incident\n0\nradiance if the satellite were to look directly at the sun, which is computed as:\nwhere S is the spectral irradiance of the sun and w is the spectral response function for the\nchannel.\nThird pass Test:\nSince sun glint often produces the same signature as smoke in visible imagery, regions with\nreflected solar angles less than a threshold value are not processed to avoid those areas\naffected by sun glint.\nFourth pass Test:\nThresholding on brightness temperature of MIR, TIR-1 and difference of these two channels\nis implemented to screen out opaque cirrus and stratus clouds. Since clouds usually have cold\ntops, they have low brightness temperatures in TIR-1 channel. Further the large difference in\nthe brightness temperatures between the MIR and the TIR-1 channels due to the reflection of\nsolar energy at 3.9¬µm is succesful in screening out water clouds.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 145\nSmoke\nFifth pass Test:\nThresholds are placed on the brightness temperature of TIR-1, TIR-2 and difference of these\ntwo channels is implemented to screen out low level moisture and cirrus clouds.\nThresholding based on differences between brightness temperatures of TIR-1 and TIR-2 are\nwidely used for cloud screening and is often referred to as the split window technique.\nPseudo Channel Index (PCI) Test :\nEven after applying the above tests , misclassification between smoke and clouds is possible.\nFor further screening, pseudo channel (CLD) is made use of and defined as:\n(TIR2) ÔÄ≠(Visible)\nCLD ÔÄΩ (3)\n(TIR2) ÔÄ´(Visible)\nwhere TIR2 and Visible refer to the radiation received in 12 Œºm and 0.65 Œºm channels\nrespectively [5].\nOwing to their different signatures in the pseudo channel, smoke plumes and clouds can be\ndiscriminated using a CLD threshold. Although in earlier studies CLD and Normalized\nDifference Vegetation Index (NDVI) feature space analysis was used for categorization of\nsmoke and cloud, it was found to generate false alarms and was eventually improved by\nusing multi-temporal change detection technique. However, in this study, it has been found\nthat combining CLD with conventional multi-threshold test also improves the robustness of\nsmoke detection. Thus pixels are further required to pass the following test,\nCLDÔÄæC (4)\n1\nwhere ‚ÄòC ‚Äô is the threshold value for smoke plumes.\n1\nIf a pixel passes all these 5 tests, surrounding pixels are checked to screen out cloud edge\npixels.A flow diagram is given to illustrate the flow of the smoke detection algorithm.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 146\nSmoke\n9.4.1.2 Flow Chart\nFigure 1: FLOW DIAGRAM FOR SMOKE DETECTION ALGORITHM\n9.4.2 Operational retrieval implementation\nThe operational implementation of the retrieval process can be enumerated as follows:\n1. Conversion of gray counts to radiance and brightness temperatures\n2. Conversion of gray counts to Albedo for the VIS channel\nThis is done with the help of conversion tables.\n3. Calculation of solar reflectance angle\nTo exclude sun glint processing path is taken for solar reflectance angle ÔÅ± greater\nr\nthan\nthreshold value (approximately 20deg)[4], where\nwhere ÔÅ± is the viewing zenith angle, ÔÅ¶ is the azimuth angle and, ÔÅ± is the Solar Zenith\n0\nAngle.\n4. Defining of thresholds\nUsing training dataset of forest fires over the Indian region for VIS, MIR , TIR-1 and\nTIR-2 channels, thresholds have to be defined for tests listed above. The methodology\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 147\nSmoke\nto be followed is to first assume initial value of thresholds based on literature and\nthen fine tune them, using visual inspection.\n5.

Aerosols have large-\nscale effects, such as their impact on climate by redistributing solar radiation (Herman\nand Browning 1975; Charlson et al. 1991; Haywood et al. 1999) and interacting with\nclouds (Platnick and Twomey 1994; Kaufman et al. 2002). Aerosol information is also\ncritical for atmospheric correction algorithms for multi-spectral satellite sensors and\nmilitary operations. The climate effects of atmospheric aerosols may be comparable to\nCO greenhouse effects, but with opposite sign and larger uncertainty (Hansen and Lacis,\n2\n1990). Aerosols have a significant impact on human life beyond the climate element.\nWhen in the lower troposphere, aerosols cause poor air quality, reduction of visibility,\nand public health hazards. Satellite remote sensing provides a means to derive aerosol\ndistribution at global and regional scales.\nThis Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes the algorithm used to\nretrieve the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) for the INSAT-3D Imager instrument\noperating from a geostationary platform. The output product description is summarized in\nTable 1.\nSpecifically, this document identifies the sources of input data, both INSAT-3D imager\nand non- INSAT-3D imager data, required for retrieval; provides the physical theory and\nmathematical background underlying the use of this information in the retrievals;\nincludes implementation details; and describes assumptions and limitations of the\nproposed approach.\nTable 1: Summary of Aerosol optical Depth (AOD) product\nParameter Units Horizontal Cell Comments\nName Size\nAerosol Optical Dimensionless 4.0 Km for both Retrieved for all the pixels\ndepth at 650 nm Land and oceans except areas of clouds\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 153\nAerosols\n10.2.2 Objective\nThe objective of this algorithm is to calculate the aerosol optical thickness, proportional\nto the total aerosol loading of the ambient aerosol, over both land and ocean for Indian\nregion on twice daily basis. As clouds block the surface reflectance, the aerosol optical\nthickness cannot be found for cloudy pixels. Retrievals are only performed during the\ndaytime due to the lack of light in the visible channel of INSAT-3D imager data during\nthe nighttime. The overall objectives of the aerosol retrieval is:\nTo determine the aerosol optical thickness, at 650 nm and 4 Km spatial resolution over\nboth land and ocean surfaces with root mean square (RMS) error of ¬±0.1. Optical\nthickness (ÔÅ¥) is related to transmission (t) by t=exp(-ÔÅ¥). Optical thickness retrievals apply\nonly under clear and daytime conditions.\n10.3 Inputs\n10.3.1 Static Data\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nDigital 5 minutes -- -- ETOPO5\nElevation\nmodel\nSpectral 1nm -- -- Sensor Group\nResponse of Space\nFunction Applications\n(SRF) for Centre,\nImager bands Ahmedabad\n10.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric 4 Km 10 bit -- Derived from\nand geometric raw data by\ncorrected DP (data\nradiance values processing)\nof visible\nchannel (0.55-\n0.75 ÔÅ≠m)\nRadiometric 4 Km 10 bit - Derived from\nand geometric raw data by\ncorrected gray DP\ncount values of\nTIR-1 channel\n(10.5)\nRadiometric 4 Km 10 bit - Derived from\nand geometric raw data by\ncorrected gray DP\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 154\nAerosols\ncount values of\nTIR-2 channel\n(11.5)\nGeolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by\nAlong with sun DP\nzenith &\nazimuth and\nsensor zenith\nand azimuth\ninformation\nAt least 20 data 4 Km\ndata for Visible\nband should be\navailable for\n1030 and 1330\nhrs for the\ngeneration of\nClear\ncomposite\nreflectance\nimage for initial\nperiod\n10.3.3 Other Auxillary data and Model Inputs\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nNCEP or\nTotal Column 50 Km -- -- INSAT-3D\nOzone SOUNDER\nconcentration\nNCEP or\nSurface 50 Km -- -- GTS through\npressure IMD\n10.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n10.4.1 Overview\nIt has been demonstrated that aerosol optical thickness can be retrieved from solar-\nreflected radiance, and that aerosol size distribution information is carried in the spectral\ndependence of aerosol optical thickness. Thus, satellite reflectance measurement limited\nto one (GOES) or two channels (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer [AVHRR])\nwere used first to derive the total aerosol content by assuming a given aerosol model.\nThe relatively homogeneous surface of the ocean enables the direct application of the\nlook up table (LUT) approach to find the aerosol optical thickness. Using the observed\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 155\nAerosols\nreflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in coordination with ancillary information\non the wind speed, water vapor, surface pressure, surface elevation, and ozone, the\ncorrected reflectances are inverted into a maritime LUT to find values of optical\nthickness.\nThe approach over land is more complicated, in that dark, vegetated surfaces are required\nfor aerosol optical depth retrieval. A near-IR band is used to identify dark, vegetated\npixels, then the surface reflectance in the visible bands is calculated from the observed\nreflectance in the near-IR band. The optical thickness is initially calculated assuming a\ncontinental aerosol model. The suspended matter information is used to choose a better\naerosol model and more accurate values of optical thickness (Kaufmann et al. 1997).\nIn spite of advances in aerosol remote sensing over land, most retrievals are limited to\nonce or twice per day, as by the morning and afternoon passes of the orbiting polar\nsatellites. Aerosols, however, show diurnal variations that would be missed by such\nsparse observations. While studies of aerosol optical depth from Sun photometers show\nlittle systematic trends (Smirnov et al. 2002), surface observations of scattering show\nsignificant diurnal patterns. It is required to understand aerosol plume movement to track\nand forecast plume movement in the interest of human health. Therefore, it is important\nto monitor the temporal aspects of aerosol.\nThe INSAT-3D imager data from geostationary platform has the potential to provide\naerosol observations over land and ocean with multiple observations per day. Many\nstudies have demonstrated the potential of Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellite (GOES) series of imager sensors to provide quantitative estimates of aerosol\noptical depth. Their sensitivity studies, however, concluded that retrievals depend on\naerosol optical property assumptions and surface reflectance. Studies using geostationary\nsatellites (e.g. GOES-8) and larger validation networks (e.g. Aerosol Robotic Network‚Äî\nAERONET) supported those initial findings. Specifically, Zhang et al. (2001) and Knapp\net al. (2002) showed that aerosol monitoring from GOES is possible for South America.\nHowever, this region has optimal retrieval conditions: surface cover with little variability\n(i.e. rainforest) and large aerosol optical depths (from biomass burning).\nRecent study by Knapp et al. (2005) has shown operational potential of GOES series of\nsensors for the monitoring of aerosol optical depth over land. A method is proposed by\nKnapp et al (2005) to correct surface effects and retrieve aerosol optical depth using\nvisible reflectance measurements from the Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellite (GOES). The surface contribution is determined from temporal compositing of\nvisible imagery, where darker pixels correspond to less atmospheric attenuation and\nsurface reflectance is deduced from the composite using radiative transfer. The method is\napplied to GOES-8 imagery over the eastern US. Retrieved surface reflectance is\ncompared with separate retrievals using a priori ground based observations of aerosol\noptical depth.\n10.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\nThe INSAT-3D imager data will be used to perform the surface reflectance and aerosol\noptical depth (ÔÅ¥) retrievals and mask for clouds. It measures top of the atmosphere (TOA)\nradiance in six channels: three at infrared wavelengths, one in the visible wavelength and\none sensitive to both solar and Earth-emitted radiance. Primarily, the visible channel\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 156\nAerosols\n(0.52‚Äì0.72 mm full width at half maximum) is sensitive to aerosol scattering, so the\nremaining channels are used for cloud masking. The cloud mask algorithm is based on\nthe Clouds from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (CLAVR)\nalgorithm (Stowe et al. 1999) which uses spectral and spatial thresholds to test for the\npresence of clouds.\nThe retrieval of aerosol information from INSAT-3D imager data is a two-step process:\n1) Cloud masking\n2) Composite the visible images to estimate the surface reflectance, and\n3) Use the surface reflectance with an image to retrieve the aerosol optical depth.\nCloud Masking\nClouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower temperature than the\nunderlying earth surface. As such, simple visible and infrared window threshold\napproaches offer considerable skill in cloud detection. Following threshold based tests\nwill be performed to detect the cloudy pixles.\na) Visible and Mid-wave Infrared Window Reflectance Threshold Test\nThe reflectance threshold test using visible band of INSTA-3D along with 3.9 micron\nchannel where values > 6% are considered to be cloudy, will be used.\nb) IR Window Temperature Threshold and Difference Tests\nSimple thresholds based cloud screening test will be established over land and ocenic\nfeatures using the TIR data of the INSAT-3D.\nSurface Reflectance Retrieval\nEstimating the surface contribution to the TOA INSAT-3D Imager visible reflectance is\ndifficult since observations will have atmospheric contamination. For instance, a visible\nobservation from INSAT-3D Imager on a cloudless day with low aerosol burden will still\nhave: gaseous absorption (primarily, ozone and water vapour); Rayleigh scattering; and\nresidual aerosol extinction. This atmospheric component to the TOA reflectance needs to\nbe removed to retrieve the surface reflectance. While studies have shown it is possible to\nestimate the surface component from observations in the near-infrared (e.g. 2.1 ÔÅ≠m)\nwhere aerosol and Rayleigh scattering are very low, the INSAT-3D imager lacks an\nobservation at this wavelength. Therefore, a compositing method will be used to estimate\nthe surface reflectance.\nThe visible imagery is composited to determine the surface contribution to the top-of-the-\natmosphere (TOA) reflectance. For each pixel in the visible image, the darkest\nobservation over the course of some time period is called the composite clear reflectance.\nBy using this value to obtain the surface reflectance, one assumes: that aerosol would\nincrease the reflectance and cloud shadows will be rare. The length of the time period is\nsomewhat subjective. In general, a long enough time period is needed for at least one\ncloud-free observation. Knapp et. al. (2005) used a two week (i.e., 14 day) period. A\nradiative transfer model, the second simulation of satellite signal in the in the solar\nspectrum (6S) will be used to convert the TOA observed reflectance to a surface\nreflectance. This atmospheric correction removes Rayleigh scattering and gaseous\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 157\nAerosols\nabsorption, leaving the Lambertian surface reflectance. This is then used in following\ncalculations to retrieve aerosol optical depth in the subsequent aerosol optical depth\nretrieval.\nCloud shadows, however, can contaminate the composite reflectance. At high solar zenith\nangles (i.e. during early morning and late afternoon), high clouds may cast large\nshadows. In the shadow regions, the direct downward solar radiance is obscured at the\nsurface, thereby reducing the surface reflectance. The second darkest observation will\nbe used in the composite clear reflectance (CCR) method to reduce the effect of cloud\nshadows. By selecting the second darkest pixel, a cloud shadow would need to be present\non at least two days during the period to affect the composite.\nThe accuracy of the composite depends on the length of time used to create it. For\ninstance, enough cloud-free observations must exist with little aerosol influence for the\nsurface reflectance to be accurate. Areas of persistent aerosol or cloud cover will be\nlikely to have caused errors in the retrieved surface reflectance because the atmospheric\ncomponent remains large in such situations.\nAtmospheric effects‚Äîaerosol extinction, Rayleigh scattering and gaseous absorption ‚Äî\nwill be removed from the composite using the second simulation of the satellite signal in\nthe solar spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model. This will retrieve the surface reflectance,\nÔÅ≤ .\nsfc\nSome aerosols are still present in the composite reflectance; their radiative effect must be\nremoved as well. This aerosol will be simulated using rural and dust aerosol model, given\nits ability to simulate the aerosol signal over the Indian region. This will represent the\naerosol extinction still present in a composite reflectance. The amount of background\naerosol is difficult to determine because it varies with season, length of CCR and time of\nday. However, it has been reported that background aerosol can vary from 0.02 to 0.08.\nAerosol Optical Depth Retrieval\nThe aerosol optical depth retrieval is performed using a INSAT-3D imager visible image\nand the retrieved surface reflectance (from the previous step). In this retrieval, the optical\ndepth of the rural and dust model in the 6S radiative transfer model is increased until the\ntheoretical reflectance matches that in the INSAT-3D imager observation.\nThe second simulation (6S) model will be used to simulate ÔÅ≤ observations. Satellite\nsat\naltitude INSAT-3D imager visible band (0.55-0.75 ÔÅ≠m) radiances will be simulated as a\nfunction of geometric angles determining the satellite viewing geometry and time of the\nday, surface reflectance R, and aerosol optical depth ( varying from 0 to 3) at 650 nm.\nThe aerosol optical depth will be retrieved using a look up table (LUT). The retrieval\nmethod then will depend on the interpolation within the LUT, finding the t which\ncorresponds to the observed ÔÅ≤ The uncertainties in such a retrieval is dependent upon\nsat .\nthe accuracy of the model parameters\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 158\nAerosols\n10.4.1.2 Flow Chart\n10.4.2 Operational Implementation\n10.4.2.1 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to Visible radiance and BT\n10.4.2.2 Step 2 : Cloud and sun glint elimination\n10.4.2.3 Step 3 : Generation of surface reflectance image using darkest\nobservations using last 20 days data\n10.4.2.4 Step 4: Atmospheric correction of INSAT-3D visible image for molecular\nscattering and gaseous absorption\n10.4.2.5 Step 5 : Correction for surface reflectance\n10.4.2.6 Step 6: Use LUTs for the inversion of aerosol optical depth (AOD)\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 159\nAerosols\n10.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nAerosol Dimensionless 0 2 15-20% 4 Km\noptical\ndepth at\n650 nm\n10.5.1 format of the output and the domain\nLat , Lon, AOD ,\nDomain :\n40 to 40 N, 30 E to 120 E\n10.6 Validation\n10.6.1 Data required\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nAERONET AERONET\nspectral AOD In-situ point -- -- sites in India\ndata observation Kanpur, Goa\nand Dharwar\nSpectral AOD Data\nusing In-situ point -- -- collection\nhandheld observation campaigns\nsunphotometer will be\norganized\nMODIS AOD 1 degree X 1 Data available\nproducts degree through\ninternet\n10.6.2 Methods of validation\nAERONET data for Validation\nPost-launch routine ground-based observations can be made using AERONET, and any\nof the several miscellaneous techniques, including the diffuse/direct method, aureole\nmeters, and polarization measurements. AeRoNet (Aerosol Robotic Network) is a\nnetwork of ground-based sun-photometers established and maintained by Brent Holben\nof Code 923 of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Tom Eck of Raytheon ITSS.\nThe sun-photometers measure the spectral aerosol optical thickness and sky radiance. In\nIndia 3 Aeronet sites namely Kanpur, Goa and Dharwar are providing systematic in-situ\nAOD measurements. Data from these sites will be used for validation of INSAT-3D\nderived AODs.\nPost-Launch Special Field Experiments\nMany of the present satellite observations are augmented by special field campaigns to\nprovide ground-truth data for the satellite-derived measurements.

The basic\ninter-comparison technique involves three steps: 1) identification of locations where both\nsensors fly over at nearly the same time; 2) extraction of data for storage in an inter-\ncomparison archive; 3) analysis of the differences between the measurements.\n10.7 Technical issues (Limitation etc.)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiation model to simulate the\nsatellite radiances. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept\nin mind.\ni) Characterization of surface reflectivity is critical of the study.

Deb\n11.2 Introduction\nThe purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Cloud Motion\nVectors (CMVs) from INSAT-3D thermal infrared imager channel and its validation\nprocedure. The INSAT-3D will have two IR window channels (10.5-11.5 ÔÅ≠m, and 11.5-\n12.5 ÔÅ≠m). In this document some background and general characteristic of satellite-derived\nCMV and INSAT-3D IR channel characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the\nvector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the\nplanned validation approach.\n11.2.1 Overview and background\nSpatio‚Äìtemporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical\nweather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of\ngeostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed\ntime interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the\ncloud mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector (CMV)\nstudies and spatio‚Äìtemporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatio‚Äìtemporal life cycle\nincludes the generation, dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a\nsequence of geostationary satellite images. During the 1970‚Äôs and early 1980‚Äôs, cloud motion\nwinds were produced in major operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental\nSatellite Data and Information Service) using a combination of automated and manual\ntechniques. Early automated techniques supplied quality low-level vectors but often yielded\nin consistent quality for mid- and high-level motions. Height assignment was automatic but\noften contained errors for semitransparent cirrus clouds. In the subsequent years, due to the\ndevelopments in image-processing and pattern recognition techniques (Merill et al., 1991), it\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 165\nCloud motion vector\nwas possible to design fully automatic techniques for CMV retrieval, and NESDIS began its\napplication in 1992. In later time, several new developments were made to make accurate\nretrievals of cloud motion winds. For example, CO2 slicing algorithm was replaced by H2O\nintercept algorithm for assigning the height to semitransparent tracers. Other improvements\nwere (i) automated correction of navigation inconsistencies within the imageries (ii)\ninclusion of spatial filters in tracer selection methodology to filter undesirable scenes.\n11.2.2 Objective\nThe main objective of this study is to derive the Cloud Motion Vectors (CMVs) over land\nand sea using multiple half hourly IR images. The region over which the winds are derived\nshould be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point.\n11.3 Inputs\n11.3.1 Static Data\nParameter Resolution Source\nContinental boundary data 4 km DP (IMD data)\n11.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and geometric pixel 10 bit -- Derived\ncorrected gray count from raw\nvalues of split window IR data by DP\nchannel (10.5-11.5 ÔÅ≠m and (data\n11.5-12.5 ÔÅ≠m) and WV processing)\nchannel (6.7 ÔÅ≠m)\n(All the data is required in\nfixed lat-lon grid for\ncontinuous 8-images\nseparated by 30 minutes\ntime interval)\nGray value to brightness - - 0.3 K Derived by\ntemperature conversion DP\ntable\nGeo-location file Pixel - 4 km Derived by\nDP\n11.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs\nParameter Resolution Accuracy Source\nNumerical model forecast\nof wind for all levels\n1 degree 2 m/s (speed) IMD\n20o (direction)\nAll levels model forecast\nTemperature 1o K\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 166\nCloud motion vector\n11.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n11.4.1 Overview\n11.4.1.1 Methodology\n11.4.1.1.1 Tracer selection\nAt the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial\ncloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target\ndomain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any\ngradients greater than 15K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also\nundergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted\ntargets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in\na template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify\nthe features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold\nvalue are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-\ndirectional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the\nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-\ngeneration satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini,\n1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment corresponding to the area\nof 32 X 32 IR pixels at the sub-satellite point. Later the selected templates undergo a spatial\ncoherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the image, to enhance the upper-\nlevel cloud. Because the spatial resolution of the infrared channel of Kalpana-1 (8 km) is\ncoarser relative to GOES (5 km) or Meteosat-7 (5 km), we used a 20 X 20 window (called a\ntemplate) to identify features in Kalpana-1 images. However in case of INSAT-3D (4 km) we\nused 32 x 32 template window. The features are selected by computing local image anomaly\nin a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy and cloud free regions. The local image\nanomaly is calculated using the following formula:\na ÔÄΩÔÉ•ÔÉ• I(i, j)ÔÄ≠I (1)\ni j\nÔÄ® ÔÄ©\nWhere I i, j represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents\nthe mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally\nproduced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This\ndifference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008). As per the location of\nthe tracer, the template window is re-located with tracer position at the centre. A schematic\ndiagram is shown in Fig. 2\n11.4.1.1.2 Height assignment\nThe height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are\nderived using the following widely used methods viz. such as the infrared window (WIN)\ntechnique or the water vapor histogram method (HIST), the H O intercept method (Nieman et\n2\nal., 1993) and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993). Once final height is selected a few\ngross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is following:\n2.1 Infrared Window Channel (WIN) and Water Vapor Histogram Methods\n(HIST):\nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing\neither infrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 167\nCloud motion vector\nforecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud\ntemperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess\nfield at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for\nEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of\ntemperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of\nopaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level\n(Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed.\nSemitransparent clouds or sub-pixel clouds give more accurate representation of the actual\nmovement of the atmosphere at a particular level. Estimation of this level is very difficult in\nthese cases since determination of the cloud top BT is affected by an unknown cloud\nemissivity or the percentage of cloud versus clear sky, respectively. The BT values are\nwarmer than observed in these cases, thus leading to estimated cloud heights that are too high\nin pressure (too low in altitude), typically resulting in an overestimation of the wind speed at\nthe estimated cloud height.\n2.2 Water Vapor‚àíInfrared Window Intercept Method (H O):\n2\nHeight assignments derived with this method are based upon the fact that radiances from two\ndifferent spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of\nview at a specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and\nopaque cloud radiances.\nÔÄ® ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ©\nR N ÔÄΩ 1ÔÄ≠nE R N ÔÄ´nER N,P (2)\ncl bcd c\nOpaque cloud radiance can be calculated from:\np ÔÅõ ÔÅù\ns db N,T(p)\nR ÔÄ® N,P ÔÄ© ÔÄΩ R ÔÄ® N ÔÄ© ÔÄ≠ ÔÉ≤t ÔÄ® N,P ÔÄ© dp (3)\nbcd c cl dp\np\nc\nwhere R is the opaque (\"black\") cloud radiance, R is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the\nbcd c1\nfractional transmittance of radiation of spectral band N emitted from the atmospheric\npressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOV covered with\ncloud, Ps is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck\nradiance of the spectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation\nrepresents the radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at\na pressure level p. This calculation is dependent upon an \"accurate\" estimation of the current\natmospheric temperature and moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model\nforecast profile. By comparing the observed radiances with the calculated radiances (for an\nobserved atmosphere defined by the model guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height\ncan be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In the Fig. 1, observed WV and IR radiances\nat each field of view (FOV) points are plotted with the calculated radiances at different\nheights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The straight line connects the\ncenter points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximate the observed surface\nand cloud conditions.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 168\nCloud motion vector\nFig 1: Measured radiances (mW m‚àí2 sr‚àí1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds (Nieman\net al., 1993)\nBy extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount\nis one (representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined.\nThe cluster determination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric\nGaussian histogram analysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and involves ten steps.\nThese steps are outlined in detail in Nieman et al., 1993. Calculated water vapor radiances\ncan be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to\ncalculated radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the\ncalculated radiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances\nobtained using the above equation. When the calculated radiances are greater than observed\nradiances, no adjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is\ndue to cloud contamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of\nwater vapor in the atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between\nthe IR and WV radiances, leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure\nvalue). The NCEP GFS model forecast are used here as guess fields.\n2.3 Cloud Base Method (BASE):\nWind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or\naltitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the\ncloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A\nmethod was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to\nestimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a\nhistogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being\nexamined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the\nhistogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region.\nAssuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid\ncloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy\ndistribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of\nthe cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same\ndistance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud\nbase temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 169\nCloud motion vector\nlocation. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those\ntargets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude\nlower than 600 hPa). This \"initial\" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous\nInfrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these\nwinds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa\n(i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa).\nOnce the infrared tracers heights using the above three algorithms and water vapor tracers\nheights using the HIST and H O methods have been calculated, the best height among the\n2\navailable heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude) value of all the\ncalculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a specific\ninfrared tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the BASE\nheight is used as the final height.\n11.4.1.1.3 Tracking\nIf a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected\ntracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a\nbigger ‚Äò‚Äòsearch window‚Äô‚Äô, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize\nthe search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also\nconsidered. The search area is optimized within ¬±30 degree from the model wind direction at\nthat level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the\nsearch window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the\ntemplate in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used\noperationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers.\nHowever, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are\ncalculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E).\nIt is defined as\nn\nÔÉ•ÔÄ®\nI ÔÄ≠I\nÔÄ©2\nt s\nE ÔÄΩ 1 ÔÄ≠ iÔÄΩ1 (4)\nn\nÔÉ•\nÔÄ®\nI ÔÄ≠I\nÔÄ©2\nt t\niÔÄΩ1\nWhere I and I are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window\nt s\nand I is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of\nt\ntemplate window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of\nthe searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is\nnormalized to values between ‚ÄìÔÇµ and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match,\nE = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0\nimplies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model\nefficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of\nE=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe\nmodel efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between -ÔÇ• and 1, towards\nthe higher end (e.g. as E ÔÉ† 1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation\ncoefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two\nobjects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main\nadvantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima,\nbecause the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 170\nCloud motion vector\ncompared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of\nmismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that\nof MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking\nmethod in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean\nregion (Deb et al., 2008).\nTracer area\nInitial grids for target Tracer area\nbefore\nselection after\noptimization\noptimization\nTracer area after Search Window\noptimization (image-2)\n(image-1)\nFig.2 : Steps involved in tracer selection and tracking\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 171\nCloud motion vector\n11.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control\nQuality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the\ncoherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the\nAMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the\nretrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at\nEUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS\n(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of\nwind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed.\nIn this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of\nimages (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 3). The\nprevious eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation\ntimescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a\ncoherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of\ncoherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality\nflag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its\nsurroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex\nnumberVc ÔÄΩu ÔÄ´iv . For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-\ni,j i,j i,j\npair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3\nneighborhood (Fig. 3), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness\ncharacteristics (to maintain the similar height).\nFig 3: A schematic diagram of quality control process.\nHere X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration\nand O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors. The vector\ndifferences (magnitude of complex numbers) are calculated as ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ ÔÄΩVc ÔÄ≠ ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ . Here\ndif i,j,t i,j,t\nVc represents the current vector at (i, j) point and ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ neighborhood vectors with\ni,j,t\nÔÄ≠1ÔÇ£i ÔÇ£1,ÔÄ≠1ÔÇ£ j ÔÇ£1 and temporal scale t varies from 1 to 8. If all spatial and temporal\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 172\nCloud motion vector\nneighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial\nneighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times.\nThe quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differencesV , excluding the\ndif\ndifference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector\nÔÅª ÔÅΩ\ndifferences V is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the\ndif\naverage of 10 V is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is\ndif\ndetermined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which\nis normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average\nof these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from\nfinal output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting,\nsearch process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it\ngoes to next previous times steps and so on.\nIf S is the mean ‚Äúspeed‚Äù of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different\nquality functions are computed as below :\nDirection Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑÔÅ± ÔÉπ 1\nDCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nA exp(ÔÄ≠S/B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n1 1 1\nSpeed Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑS ÔÉπ 2\nSCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n2 2 2\nVector Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑV ÔÉπ 3\nVCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n3 3 3\nSpacial Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑV ÔÉπ 4\nPCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( m )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n4 4 2\nIn the above formulation, ÔÅÑÔÅ±,ÔÅÑS,ÔÅÑV represent the difference of direction (degrees),\ndifference of speed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite\nwind component.

The best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference.\nQuantities A B ,C , and D are constants. The final quality indicator of a wind vector is\nN, N N N\ngiven as\nDCF ÔÄ´SCF ÔÄ´VCF ÔÄ´PCF\nQI =\n4.0\nAll the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected.\nIn the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets\n(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they don‚Äôt get ‚Äúsupport‚Äù.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 173\nCloud motion vector\nHundreds of ‚Äúisolated‚Äù vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real\nsituation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the\npast eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level\nand captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly,\nif we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30\nUTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and\nrepresented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is\nused for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the\nsecond image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds\nretrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as\n04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine\nimages. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and\nprocess is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of\nvalid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently.\n11.4.2 Operational Implementation\n11.4.2.1 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT\nÔÇ∑ In this step a radiation model will be used to convert the instrument measured\nradiances into brightness temperature.

In this case the\nbrightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with\ncollocated numerical model temperature profile.

This search will be done in the direction of ÔÇ± 30o of model wind.\n11.4.2.5 Step 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control\nÔÇ∑ The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images\n(viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored\nin a file.

These statistics can provide a fixed measure of\nproduct quality over time and can be employed in determining observation weight in\nobjective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked\nWinds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production quality should be\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 175\nCloud motion vector\naccomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The recommended three parts to\nthe report.\ni) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and\nsatellite winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa)\nlevels together with the radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for\nthree latitude bands: north of 20 N, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of\n20 S.\nii) Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water\nvapor motion vectors through the last 12 months.\niii) Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm.\nThe vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated\nradiosonde report used for verification is given by\n(VD) = [ (Ui ‚Äì Ur)2 + (Vi ‚Äì Vr)2 ]1/2\nThe speed bias is given by\nN\n(BIAS)i = 1/N ‚àë [( Ui2 + V i2 )1/2 - (Ur2 + Vr2 )1/2 ]\ni=1\nThe mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is\nN\n(MVD) = 1/N ‚àë (VD)i\ni=1\nAnd the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally\nreported is\nN\n(SD) = [1/N ‚àë ( (Vdi) ‚Äì (MVD) )2 ]1/2\nI=1\nThe root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum\nof the squares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean\nvector difference,\n(RMSE) = [(MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2\nIt must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the\nmean component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the\nsquares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector.\nN\n(‚àÜU2) = ‚àë (Ui ‚ÄìUr)2\ni=1\nN\n(‚àÜV2) = ‚àë (Vi ‚ÄìVr)2\ni=1\n(MCD) = [ (‚àÜU2) + (‚àÜV2) ]1/2 ‚â† (MVD)\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 176\nCloud motion vector\nTo avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report\nmean vector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy\naccording to CGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for\nWV winds should be 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The\nmean bias for both sets of winds should be about zero.\n11.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If\nthe registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased.\nHowever the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The\nspatially coherent, high resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible\nfrom geostationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. CMV are comparable in\nquality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors\nin regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to\nobtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong\nsubsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; however,\nupper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations.\n1. Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed\nretrieval\nThis sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different\nvertical levels as well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity\nof atmospheric jets, the retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in\nthe assigned pressure levels. Based on some standard analysis ( e.g. NCEP reanalysis\nof 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a quantitative assessment of the vertical and\nspatial structure of this sensitivity.\n2. Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment\nWe plan to use IMD‚Äôs operational regional model output during height assignment\nprocedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of\nAMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational\nmodel, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM\nwill be generated over the regions not covered by IMD‚Äôs regional model.\n3. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment\nTo use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to\nfind the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may\nincrease the AMV turn-around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway\nto develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR\nand water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this\nempirical model will then be used in real-time applications.\n4. Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods\nfor tracking of cloud-tracers.\nThe comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was\nfound that the efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 177\nCloud motion vector\ncross correlation (MCC) methods are comparable, while the MDM method is\nsignificantly faster than MCC.\n11.8 References\n1.

The INSAT-\n3D will have one water vapor channel (6.3 -7.1 (m). In this document some background\nand general characteristic of satellite-derived WVWV products, the methodology employed\nto derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and practical aspects of this algorithm and\noutlined the planned validation approach.\n12.2.1 Overview and background\nIn early nineties, forecasters have used extensively the water vapor radiances from geo-\nstationary satellites qualitatively (Weldon and Holmes 1991). In quantitative studies, the\nfirst attempt was made by Hayden and Stewart (Hayden and Stewart 1987) by manually\ntracking moisture features in automated image sequences. Later studies (Laurent 1993,\nVelden 1993, Holmlund 1993) on this area have shown much maturity with ability of\nautomated wind extraction methods for producing spatially coherent Water Vapor Wind\nVector (WVWV) fields comparable in quality to operational cloud-tracked winds. The\nsuccessful implementation of University of Wisconsin-Madison Co-operative Institute for\nMeteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS) automated wind-extraction algorithm\noperationally at National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service (NESDIS)\nhave shown considerable improvement in this regards (Nieman et. al 1997). However, the\nquality control (QC) of WVWV fields still demanded intensive manual intervention. In\n1992, NESDIS began the use of first version of new automated winds (CIMSS) software\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 182\nWater vapor wind\npackage and producing full disk wind set without manual intervention since 1997 by\nsuitably selecting tracers (filtering undesirable scenes) and assigning heights using several\nmethods. The tracking features in subsequent imagery was automated using advanced\npattern matching techniques (Merrill et al. 1991) and an automated quality control\nalgorithm was also implemented. Laurent (1993) reports on Water Vapor (WV) wind\nextraction from Meteosat image data that is carried out under operational conditions.\nSubsequent years further development has been made by adding quality indicators\n(Holmlund 1998) to supply the users with additional information about the products. The\nU.S Geo-stationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-8 etc series) are equipped\nwith one imager and two sounder water vapor channels. As of GOES-12 the spatial\nresolution of the WV imager has been improved from 8Km to 4 Km at the sub-satellite\npoint, and the radiometer is spectrally wider with a central wavelength of 6.5 micro m\ninstead 6.7 micro m. The sounders look progressively deeper into the troposphere as the\nspectral band wavelength moves away from the 6.3micro m absorption band center.\n(Menzel et al 1998). This facts opens the opportunity for a 3-dimensional reconstruction of\natmospheric motions (Menzel 2001). Water vapor winds from image data taken by the WV\nchannel aboard the Japanese satellite Geo-stationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS)-5\nhave been produced since 1995, and clear-sky WV segments have been separated since\n1998 (Tokuno 1996, 1998). Tokuno et al. (2002) state that the appropriate height\nassignment of clear-sky WV motion vectors is still an unresolved task.\nGeo-stationary satellites of the Fengyun-2 series are operated by the National Satellite\nMeteorological Center of China since 1997 (Xu et al. 1998). These satellites are equipped\nwith a water vapor channel as well. The method to evaluate atmospheric motion vectors\ncompromises new features (Xu et al. 2002) that are unconventional relative to the earlier\nschemes applied to the data from Meteosat or GOES.\nThe study Buche et al. (2006) has shown improvement in Water Vapor structure\ndisplacements both in smooth and shallow scenes by using proper filters. He then tested a\nseries of height assignment methods using altitude-based parameters such as wind shear\nand brightness contrast of pixels. This study reveals that for the cases of strong wind shear\nthe methods that use the effective brightness temperature from the coldest pixels lead to\nbetter height assignments than do others that are based on the contribution function\nexplicitly.\n12.2.2 Objective\nThe main objective of this study is to derive the water vapor wind vectors over land and sea\nusing multiple half hourly Water Vapor images. The region over which the winds are\nderived should be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point.\n12.3 Inputs\n12.3.1 Static Data\nParameter Resolution Source\nContinental 4 km\nboundary DP (IMD data)\ndata\nLand Sea mask 8 km\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 183\nWater vapor wind\n12.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit -- Derived from\ngeometric corrected raw data by\ngray count values of DP (data\nWV channel (6.7) processing)\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit -- Derived from\ngeometric corrected raw data by\ngray count values of DP (data\nIR channel (10.5) processing)\nGray value to - - 0.3 K Derived by\nbrightness DP\ntemperature\nconversion table\nGeolocation file Pixel - 4 km Derived by\nDP\n12.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs\nParameter Resolution Accuracy Source\nNumerical\nmodel forecast 2 m/s (speed)\nof wind for all 20o (direction)\nlevels 0.5 degree IMD\nAll levels model\nforecast 1 K\ntemperature\n12.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n12.4.1 Overview\nThe procedure for deriving Water Vapor Wind Vector (WVWV) will be followed the\nbasic methods employed for cloud tracking described in Merrill 1989, 1991 with some\nupgrade in Velden et al. 1997. The vertical distribution of WVWV is dependent on\nseveral key factors: 1) characteristics of the spectral channel, such as central wavelength\nand band width; 2) air-mass characteristics, such as cloudiness and vertical moisture\nprofile; 3) season (less moisture in the cool season leads to lower mean heights); and 4)\nlatitude (higher moisture content and tropopause in the tropics leads to higher mean\nheights). In regard to the first point, the operational geo-stationary weather satellites with\nwater vapor channels (GOES, Meteosat, and GMS) have similar features. The coverage\nattainable from WVWV is quite uniform in most cases, since the observed displacement\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 184\nWater vapor wind\nof a large portion of the targeted features is a result of pure moisture advection and\nadequately represents the instantaneous wind. The coverage is especially complete in the\nsummertime tropics due to the presence of abundant moisture. However there are\nsituations when extraction of useful WVWV information is difficult, if not impossible.\nThese situations are summarized as: 1) very dry air masses lacking in moisture features,\nwhich prohibits good target selection; 2) regions of strong vertical motion, in which a\ncoherent radiance signal can be significantly attenuated over the tracking interval; 3)\nuniform moisture fields lacking in contrast; 4) strong vertical shear zones, which can be\ndeform targets over the tracking interval; and 5) rapidly amplifying extra-tropical\ntroughs, which contain a large phase speed component. The above conditions represent\nrelatively rare situations when considering full-disk coverage. As a whole the coverage\nand quality of WVWV will vary depending on atmospheric factors such as moisture\navailability and structure, vertical shear, and instrument characteristics such as detector\nprecision and resolution.\n12.4.1.1 Methodology\nThe main components for the process of WVWV detection are the following:\nÔÇ∑ Tracer selection\nÔÇ∑ Height assignment\nÔÇ∑ Tracking\nÔÇ∑ Wind buffer generation and Quality control\nBefore going to details, a crux of such approaches is given in the following steps:\nÔÇ∑ The tracer whose displacement is to be detected in subsequent WV image frames\nis selected.\nÔÇ∑ Let the source image s and target image t is registered to same scale. For every\ngiven m x m (typically 32 x 32 pixels) sub-image c of the tracer in image s, an n x\ns\nn (n > m) search window w is selected in t. The center co-ordinates of c and w\nt s t\nare identical as s and t are registered to the same scale.\nÔÇ∑ Given c and w, the problem of detection of WVWV is to find out best correlation\ns t\nmeasure between c and any one of m x m sub-image within w. The vector\ns t\noriginating from the center co-ordinate of c to the center of best-matched m x m\ns\nsub-image of w gives the WVWV.\nt\nÔÇ∑ The correlation measures are some sort of similarity measure between time\nvarying sub-images. This similarity measures can be accomplished either by\nmaximum cross-correlation or sum of the squared difference measure or by Nash-\nSutcliffe model efficiency function (Deb et al. 2008).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 185\nWater vapor wind\nFigure 1: The schematic for WVWV detection process\nThe description of each step is given in the following:\n12.4.1.1.1 Tracer selection:\nAt the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial\ncloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target\ndomain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any\ngradients greater than 15K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also\nundergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted\ntargets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in\na template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify\nthe features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold\nvalue are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-\ndirectional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the\nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-\ngeneration satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini,\n1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment corresponding to the area\nof 32 X 32 IR pixels at the sub-satellite point. Later the selected templates undergo a spatial\ncoherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the image, to enhance the upper-\nlevel cloud. Because the spatial resolution of the water vapor channel of Kalpana-1 (8 km) is\ncoarser relative to GOES (5 km) or Meteosat-7 (5 km), we used a 20 X 20 window (called a\ntemplate) to identify features in Kalpana-1 images. However in case of INSAT-3D (4 km) we\nused 32 x 32 template window. The features are selected by computing local image anomaly\nin a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy and cloud free regions. The local image\nanomaly is calculated using the following formula:\na ÔÄΩÔÉ•ÔÉ• I(i, j)ÔÄ≠I (1)\ni j\nÔÄ® ÔÄ©\nWhere I i, j represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents\nthe mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally\nproduced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This\ndifference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 186\nWater vapor wind\n12.4.1.1.2 Height assignment\nThe height assignments of the selected tracers corresponding to each retrieved vectors are\nderived using the following widely used methods viz. the water vapor histogram method\n(HIST) and the H O intercept method (Nieman et al., 1993). Once final height is selected a\n2\nfew gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of each method is following:\na. Water Vapor Histogram Methods (HIST):\nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing\neither infrared window or water vapor brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model\nforecast temperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud\ntemperature, which is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess\nfield at the target location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for\nEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of\ntemperature profile. This method works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of\nopaque clouds usually does not accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level\n(Nieman et al., 1993), resulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed.\nSemitransparent clouds or sub-pixel clouds give more accurate representation of the actual\nmovement of the atmosphere at a particular level. Estimation of this level is very difficult in\nthese cases since determination of the cloud top BT is affected by an unknown cloud\nemissivity or the percentage of cloud versus clear sky, respectively. The BT values are\nwarmer than observed in these cases, thus leading to estimated cloud heights that are too high\nin pressure (too low in altitude), typically resulting in an overestimation of the wind speed at\nthe estimated cloud height.\nb. Water Vapor‚àíInfrared Window Intercept Method (H O):\n2\nHeight assignments derived with this method are based upon the fact that radiances from two\ndifferent spectral bands are linearly related for different cloud amounts within the field of\nview at a specified height. Observed radiance measurements are a function of clear sky and\nopaque cloud radiances.\nÔÄ® ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ© ÔÄ® ÔÄ©\nR N ÔÄΩ 1ÔÄ≠nE R N ÔÄ´nER N,P (2)\ncl bcd c\nOpaque cloud radiance can be calculated from:\np ÔÅõ ÔÅù\ns db N,T(p)\nR ÔÄ® N,P ÔÄ© ÔÄΩ R ÔÄ® N ÔÄ© ÔÄ≠ ÔÉ≤t ÔÄ® N,P ÔÄ© dp (3)\nbcd c cl dp\np\nc\nwhere R is the opaque (\"black\") cloud radiance, R is the clear sky radiance, t(N,p) is the\nbcd c1\nfractional transmittance of radiation of spectral band N emitted from the atmospheric\npressure p arriving at the top of the atmosphere (p=0), n is the fraction of FOV covered with\ncloud, Ps is the surface pressure, Pc is the cloud pressure, and b[N,T(p)] is the Planck\nradiance of the spectral band N for a temperature T(p). The second part of the above equation\nrepresents the radiance decrease from clear sky conditions introduced by an opaque cloud at\na pressure level p. This calculation is dependent upon an \"accurate\" estimation of the current\natmospheric temperature and moisture structure, which are provided by a NWP model\nforecast profile. By comparing the observed radiances with the calculated radiances (for an\nobserved atmosphere defined by the model guess profiles), an estimation of the cloud height\ncan be derived for a completely opaque cloud. In the Fig. 2, observed WV and IR radiances\nat each field of view (FOV) points are plotted with the calculated radiances at different\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 187\nWater vapor wind\nheights for opaque clouds in the atmosphere (curved line). The straight line connects the\ncenter points of the warmest and coldest clusters, which approximate the observed surface\nand cloud conditions.\nFig 2: Measured radiances (mW m‚àí2 sr‚àí1 cm) for fields of view partially filled with clouds\n(Nieman et al., 1993)\nBy extrapolating this line to intersect the calculated radiance curve, where the cloud amount\nis one (representing an opaque cloud), the cloud top temperature/pressure can be determined.\nThe cluster determination algorithm used is a modified version of the bivariate asymmetric\nGaussian histogram analysis (Rossow et al., 1985; Tomassini, 1981), and involves ten steps.\nThese steps are outlined in detail in Nieman et al., 1993. Calculated water vapor radiances\ncan be in error due to incorrect NWP model forecast profiles. This error would lead to\ncalculated radiances being systematically higher or lower than observed radiances. When the\ncalculated radiances are systematically lower, an adjustment is applied to the radiances\nobtained using the above equation. When the calculated radiances are greater than observed\nradiances, no adjustment is applied since it is assumed that the lower measured radiance is\ndue to cloud contamination. The accuracy of this method can be affected by the amount of\nwater vapor in the atmosphere. Dry atmospheric conditions lead to a steeper slope between\nthe IR and WV radiances, leading to an overestimate in the target height (lower pressure\nvalue). The NCEP GFS model forecast are used here as guess fields.\nOnce the water vapor tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated,\nthe best height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest\naltitude) value of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height.\n12.4.1.1.3 Tracking:\nIf a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected\ntracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a\nbigger ‚Äò‚Äòsearch window‚Äô‚Äô, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize\nthe search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also\nconsidered. The search area is optimized within ¬±30 degree from the model wind direction at\nthat level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the\nsearch window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 188\nWater vapor wind\ntemplate in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used\noperationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers.\nHowever, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are\ncalculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E).\nIt is defined as\nn\nÔÉ•ÔÄ®I ÔÄ≠I ÔÄ©2\nt s (4)\nE ÔÄΩ 1 ÔÄ≠ iÔÄΩ1\nÔÉ• n ÔÄ® I ÔÄ≠I ÔÄ©2\nt t\niÔÄΩ1\nWhere I and I are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window\nt s\nand I is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of\nt\ntemplate window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of\nthe searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is\nnormalized to values between ‚ÄìÔÇµ and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match,\nE = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0\nimplies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model\nefficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of\nE=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe\nmodel efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between -ÔÇ• and 1, towards\nthe higher end (e.g. as E ÔÉ† 1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation\ncoefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two\nobjects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main\nadvantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima,\nbecause the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features\ncompared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of\nmismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that\nof MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking\nmethod in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean\nregion (Deb et al., 2008).\n12.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control\nQuality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the\ncoherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the\nAMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the\nretrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (Holmlund, 1998) followed at\nEUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS\n(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of\nwind buffer generation and quality control procedure is proposed and implemented first time\nin AMV retrieval. In this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images\nbetween a pair of images (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a\nfile (Fig. 3). The previous eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour\ndecorrelation timescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure\nconsists of a coherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector\nand degree of coherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The\nvalue of quality flag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given\nvector with its surroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 189\nWater vapor wind\nnumberVc ÔÄΩu ÔÄ´iv . For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-\ni,j i,j i,j\npair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3\nneighborhood (Fig. 3), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness\ncharacteristics (to maintain the similar height).\nFig 3: A schematic diagram of quality control process.\nHere X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration\nand O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors. The vector\ndifferences (magnitude of complex numbers) are calculated as ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ ÔÄΩVc ÔÄ≠ ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ . Here\ndif i,j,t i,j,t\nVc represents the current vector at (i, j) point and ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ neighborhood vectors with\ni,j,t\nÔÄ≠1ÔÇ£i ÔÇ£1,ÔÄ≠1ÔÇ£ j ÔÇ£1 and temporal scale t varies from 1 to 8. If all spatial and temporal\nneighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial\nneighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times.\nThe quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differencesV , excluding the\ndif\ndifference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector\nÔÅª ÔÅΩ\ndifferences V is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the\ndif\naverage of 10 V is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is\ndif\ndetermined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which\nis normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average\nof these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from\nfinal output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting,\nsearch process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it\ngoes to next previous times steps and so on.\nIf S is the mean ‚Äúspeed‚Äù of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different\nquality functions are computed as below :\nDirection Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑÔÅ± ÔÉπ 1\nDCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nA exp(ÔÄ≠S/B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n1 1 1\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 190\nWater vapor wind\nSpeed Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑS ÔÉπ 2\nSCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n2 2 2\nVector Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑV ÔÉπ 3\nVCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n3 3 3\nSpacial Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑV ÔÉπ 4\nPCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( m )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n4 4 2\nIn the above formulation, ÔÅÑÔÅ±,ÔÅÑS,ÔÅÑV represent the difference of direction (degrees),\ndifference of speed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite\nwind component. ÔÅÑV is the length of difference vector between satellite wind component\nm\nand its best neighbor. The best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference.\nQuantities A B , C , and D are constants. The final quality indicator of a wind vector is\nN, , N N N\ngiven as\nDCF ÔÄ´SCF ÔÄ´VCF ÔÄ´PCF\nQI =\n4.0\nAll the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected.\nIn the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets\n(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they don‚Äôt get ‚Äúsupport‚Äù.\nHundreds of ‚Äúisolated‚Äù vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real\nsituation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the\npast eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level\nand captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly,\nif we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30\nUTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and\nrepresented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is\nused for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the\nsecond image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds\nretrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as\n04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine\nimages. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and\nprocess is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of\nvalid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently.\nThe height assignment of WVWV is a long-standing problem in this regard. In cloud free\nregions, the radiometric signal from pure water vapor structure is a result of emittance over a\nfinite layer. It is further complicated by radiance contributions from multiple moist layer\n(Weldon and Holmes 1991). Here the challenge is to assign a height that best represents the\nmotion of the feature. In the first step, the instrument measured radiances is converted into\nbrightness temperature, which requires an accurate definition of the spectral response of the\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 191\nWater vapor wind\ninstrument. It is important to note that the different instruments are sensing radiation from\nslightly different parts of the H O absorption band. Sampling the center of the absorption\n2\nband (around 6.3¬µm) yields radiation from upper levels of the troposphere. Sampling away\nfrom the center of the absorption band yields radiation from lower levels of the troposphere.\nOnce the target is selected for tracking, the brightness temperature in the target area is\naveraged and this value will be matched with a collocated model guess temperature profile.\nThe level of optimum fit will be used to assign an initial pressure height.\n12.4.2 Operational Implementation\n1.4.2.1 Step 1 : Conversion from gray count to BT\nÔÇ∑ In this step a radiation model will be used to convert the instrument measured\nradiances into brightness temperature. This requires an accurate definition of the\nspectral response of the satellite.\nÔÇ∑ It is important that the different instruments are sensing radiation from slightly\ndifferent parts of H O absorption band. Sampling the centre of the absorption\n2\nband yields radiation from the upper levels of the troposphere, similarly sampling\naway from the centre of the absorption band yields radiation from lower levels of\nthe atmosphere\n12.4.2.2 Step 2: Tracer selection from image\nÔÇ∑ Water-vapor images tracer selection will be done by evaluating local image\nanomaly surrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum\nbrightness temperature of the window exceeding some thresholds value.\n12.4.2.3 Step 3: Height assignment\nÔÇ∑ Assign height of the selected tracer using water vapor histogram technique. In\nthis case the brightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and\nmatched with collocated numerical model temperature profile. The level of\noptimum fit will be assigned as initial height.\nÔÇ∑ Re-assign the height using H O intercept technique for semi-transparent tracers.\n2\nÔÇ∑ Assign correct height after implementing all the height assignment technique\nmentioned above.\n12.4.2.4 Step 4: Tracking\nÔÇ∑ The tracking employs a simple search for the minimum in the sum of squares of\nthe radiance difference between the target and search arrays in subsequent half\nhourly images. This search will be done in the direction of ÔÇ± 30o of model wind.\n12.4.2.5 Step 5: Wind buffer generation & quality control\nÔÇ∑ The wind buffer is created using previous eight images between pairs of images\n(viz. the winds retrieved between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored\nin a file. The selection of eight images is consistent with decorrelation\ntimescales of winds over tropical region.\nÔÇ∑ Use quality control criteria for selecting wind using the wind buffer.\nÔÇ∑ Again calculate wind speed and direction.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 192\nWater vapor wind\n12.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nU and V component of WVWV m/sec 0 70 5 -6 m/s 0.5 ‚Äì 2.5 deg\nDomain of output : 30oE ‚Äì 130oE :: 50o S ‚Äì 50o N\n12.5.1 Format of the output and the domain\nAs output of WVWV the following parameters will be provided to IMD:\nÔÇ∑ Zonal and meridional components of the wind vectors.\nÔÇ∑ Latitudinal and longitudinal position.\nÔÇ∑ Height of WVWV\nThe format of the final product will be like this:\nParameter Lat.

The traditional method of validation is matching observations with\ncollocated Rawinsondes. The statistical validation will be done according to the CGMS\nwinds evaluation reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed measure of\nproduct quality over time and can be employed in determining observation weight in\nobjective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on Satellite Tracked\nWinds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production quality should be\naccomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The recommended three parts to\nthe report.\n(i) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between Rawinsondes and\nsatellite winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa)\nlevels together with the Rawinsonde mean wind speed.

The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the squares of the\ndeviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector.\nN\n(‚àÜU2) = ‚àë (Ui ‚ÄìUr)2\ni=1\nN\n(‚àÜV2) = ‚àë (Vi ‚ÄìVr)2\ni=1\n(MCD) = [ (‚àÜU2) + (‚àÜV2) ]1/2 ‚â† (MVD)\nTo avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean\nvector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to\nCGMS guideline for WVWV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds\nshould be 7m/s respectively with respect to Rawinsonde observations. The mean bias for\nboth sets of winds should be about zero.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 194\nWater vapor wind\n12.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. Assuming\nthe registration has an error of 1 pixel then error of the final product will be of 5 m/sec.\nHowever the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially\ncoherent, high-resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible from geo-\nstationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. WVWV are comparable in quality to\noperational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are\nlacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-able\ninformation in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The\nindividual vectors represent single level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles\nare possible by using multi-spectral observations.\n12.8 References\n1.

The INSAT-3D will have\none visible channel (0.55 ‚Äì 0.75 (m). In this document some background and general\ncharacteristic of satellite-derived winds from visible channels and INSAT-3D visible\nchannel characteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical\nbasis and practical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach.\n13.2.1 Overview and background\nSpatio‚Äìtemporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical\nweather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of\ngeostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed\ntime interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the\ncloud mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector studies\nand spatio‚Äìtemporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatio‚Äìtemporal life cycle includes the\ngeneration, dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a sequence of\ngeostationary satellite images. During the 1970‚Äôs and early 1980‚Äôs, cloud motion winds were\nproduced in major operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite Data\nand Information Service) using a combination of automated and manual techniques. Early\nautomated techniques supplied quality low-level vectors from visible channels but often\nyielded in consistent quality for mid- and high-level motions. Height assignment for the\nvisible winds is done with collocated infrared images using infrared window technique. In\nthe subsequent years, due to the developments in image-processing and pattern recognition\ntechniques (Merill et al., 1991), it was possible to design fully automatic techniques for wind\nretrieval, and NESDIS began its application in 1992. In later time, several new developments\nwere made to make accurate retrievals of winds from satellite images.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 201\nVisible wind vectors\n13.2.2 Objective\nThe main objective of this study is to derive the Visible Winds (VIS) over sea using multiple\nsuccessive half hourly VIS images. The region over which the winds are derived should be in\nthe range of 500 from sub-satellite point.\n13.3 Inputs\n13.3.1 Static Data\nParameter Resolution Source\nContinental boundary data 1 km DP (IMD data)\n13.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and geometric pixel 10 bit -- Derived\ncorrected gray count from raw\nvalues of split window IR data by DP\nchannel (10.5-11.5 ÔÅ≠m and (data\n11.5-12.5 ÔÅ≠m) and VIS processing)\nchannel (0.65 ÔÅ≠m)\n(All the data is required in\nfixed lat-lon grid for\ncontinuous 8-images\nseparated by 30 minutes\ntime interval)\nGray value to brightness - - 0.3 K Derived by\ntemperature conversion DP\ntable\nGeo-location file Pixel - 1 km Derived by\nDP\n13.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs\nParameter Resolution Accuracy Source\nNumerical model forecast 1 degree or 0.5 2 m/s IMD\nof wind for all levels degree (speed)\n20o\n(direction)\nAll levels model forecast\nTemperature 1o K\n13.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n13.4.1 Overview\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 202\nVisible wind vectors\n13.4.1.1 Methodology\n13.4.1.1.1 Tracer selection and Tracking\nAt the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial\ncloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target\ndomain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any\ngradients greater than 150K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also\nundergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted\ntargets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in\na template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify\nthe features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold\nvalue are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-\ndirectional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the\nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-\ngeneration satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini,\n1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the selected\ntemplates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the\nimage, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by\ncomputing local image anomaly in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy regions of the\nvisible images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula:\na ÔÄΩÔÉ•ÔÉ• I(i, j)ÔÄ≠I (1)\ni j\nÔÄ® ÔÄ©\nWhere I i, j represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents\nthe mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally\nproduced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This\ndifference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008).\n13.4.1.1.2 Height assignment\nThe height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are\nderived using the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz.\nsuch as the infrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993).\nOnce final height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of\neach method is following:\n2.4 Infrared Window Channel (WIN):\nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing\neither infrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast\ntemperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature,\nwhich is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the\ntarget location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental\nPrediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This\nmethod works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of opaque clouds usually does\nnot accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993),\nresulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed.\n2.5 Cloud Base Method (BASE):\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 203\nVisible wind vectors\nWind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or\naltitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the\ncloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A\nmethod was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to\nestimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a\nhistogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being\nexamined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the\nhistogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region.\nAssuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid\ncloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy\ndistribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of\nthe cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same\ndistance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud\nbase temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target\nlocation. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those\ntargets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude\nlower than 600 hPa). This \"initial\" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous\nInfrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these\nwinds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa\n(i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa).\nOnce the visible tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated, the\nbest height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest altitude)\nvalue of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height. However, if for a\nspecific visible tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available, then the\nBASE height is used as the final height.\n13.4.1.1.3 Tracking\nIf a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected\ntracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a\nbigger ‚Äò‚Äòsearch window‚Äô‚Äô, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize\nthe search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also\nconsidered. The search area is optimized within ¬±30 degree from the model wind direction at\nthat level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the\nsearch window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the\ntemplate in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used\noperationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers.\nHowever, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are\ncalculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E).\nIt is defined as\nn\nÔÉ•ÔÄ®\nI ÔÄ≠I\nÔÄ©2\nt s\nE ÔÄΩ 1 ÔÄ≠ iÔÄΩ1 (2)\nn\nÔÉ•\nÔÄ®\nI ÔÄ≠I\nÔÄ©2\nt t\niÔÄΩ1\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 204\nVisible wind vectors\nWhere I and I are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window\nt s\nand I is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of\nt\ntemplate window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of\nthe searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is\nnormalized to values between ‚ÄìÔÇµ and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match,\nE = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0\nimplies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model\nefficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of\nE=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe\nmodel efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between -ÔÇ• and 1, towards\nthe higher end (e.g. as E ÔÉ† 1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation\ncoefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two\nobjects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main\nadvantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima,\nbecause the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features\ncompared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of\nmismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that\nof MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking\nmethod in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean\nregion (Deb et al., 2008).\n13.4.1.1.4: Wind buffer generation and Quality control\nQuality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the\ncoherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the\nAMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the\nretrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at\nEUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS\n(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of\nwind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed.\nIn this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of\nimages (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 1). The\nprevious eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation\ntimescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a\ncoherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of\ncoherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality\nflag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its\nsurroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex\nnumberVc ÔÄΩu ÔÄ´iv . For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-\ni,j i,j i,j\npair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3\nneighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness\ncharacteristics (to maintain the similar height).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 205\nVisible wind vectors\nFig 1: A schematic diagram of quality control process.\nHere X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration\nand O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors. The vector\ndifferences (magnitude of complex numbers) are calculated as ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ ÔÄΩVc ÔÄ≠ ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ . Here\ndif i,j,t i,j,t\nVc represents the current vector at (i, j) point and ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ neighborhood vectors with\ni,j,t\nÔÄ≠1ÔÇ£i ÔÇ£1,ÔÄ≠1ÔÇ£ j ÔÇ£1 and temporal scale t varies from 1 to 8. If all spatial and temporal\nneighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial\nneighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times.\nThe quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differencesV , excluding the\ndif\ndifference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector\nÔÅª ÔÅΩ\ndifferences V is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the\ndif\naverage of 10 V is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is\ndif\ndetermined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which\nis normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average\nof these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from\nfinal output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting,\nsearch process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it\ngoes to next previous times steps and so on.\nIf S is the mean ‚Äúspeed‚Äù of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different\nquality functions are computed as below :\nDirection Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑÔÅ± ÔÉπ 1\nDCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nA exp(ÔÄ≠S/B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n1 1 1\nSpeed Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑS ÔÉπ 2\nSCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n2 2 2\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 206\nVisible wind vectors\nVector Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑV ÔÉπ 3\nVCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n3 3 3\nSpacial Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑV ÔÉπ 4\nPCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( m )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n4 4 2\nIn the above formulation, ÔÅÑÔÅ±,ÔÅÑS,ÔÅÑV represent the difference of direction (degrees),\ndifference of speed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite\nwind component. ÔÅÑV is the length of difference vector between satellite wind component\nm\nand its best neighbor. The best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference.\nQuantities A B ,C , and D are constants. The final quality indicator of a wind vector is\nN, N N N\ngiven as\nDCF ÔÄ´SCF ÔÄ´VCF ÔÄ´PCF\nQI =\n4.0\nAll the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected.\nIn the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets\n(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they don‚Äôt get ‚Äúsupport‚Äù.\nHundreds of ‚Äúisolated‚Äù vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real\nsituation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the\npast eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level\nand captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly,\nif we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30\nUTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and\nrepresented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is\nused for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the\nsecond image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds\nretrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as\n04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine\nimages. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and\nprocess is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of\nvalid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently.\n13.4.2 Operational Implementation\n13.4.2.1 Step 1: Tracer selection from image\nÔÇ∑ Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly\nsurrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness\ntemperature of the window.\n13.4.2.2 Step 2: Height assignment\nÔÇ∑ Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique. In this case the\nbrightness temperature in the target window will be averaged and matched with\ncollocated numerical model temperature profile.

Quantitative assessment of the VIS winds product is possible from statistical\nanalyses and impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching\nobservations with collocated radiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according\nto the CGMS winds evaluation reporting guidelines. These statistics can provide a fixed\nmeasure of product quality over time and can be employed in determining observation\nweight in objective data assimilation. At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on\nSatellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production\nquality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The\nrecommended three parts to the report.\ni) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and\nsatellite winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) levels\ntogether with the radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for three latitude\nbands: north of 20 N, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S.\nii) Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water\nvapor motion vectors through the last 12 months.\niii) Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm.\nThe vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated\nradiosonde report used for verification is given by\n(VD) = [ (Ui ‚Äì Ur)2 + (Vi ‚Äì Vr)2 ]1/2\nThe speed bias is given by\nN\n(BIAS)i = 1/N ‚àë [( Ui2 + V i2 )1/2 - (Ur2 + Vr2 )1/2 ]\ni=1\nThe mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is\nN\n(MVD) = 1/N ‚àë (VD)i\ni=1\nAnd the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally\nreported is\nN\n(SD) = [1/N ‚àë ( (Vdi) ‚Äì (MVD) )2 ]1/2\nI=1\nThe root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum\nof the squares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean\nvector difference,\n(RMSE) = [ (MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2\nIt must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the\nmean component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the\nsquares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 209\nVisible wind vectors\nN\n(‚àÜU2) = ‚àë (Ui ‚ÄìUr)2\ni=1\nN\n(‚àÜV2) = ‚àë (Vi ‚ÄìVr)2\ni=1\nTo avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted.

The standard accuracy\naccording to CGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for\nWV winds should be 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The\nmean bias for both sets of winds should be about zero.\n13.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If\nthe registration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased.\nHowever the following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The\nspatially coherent, high resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds are possible\nfrom geostationary satellite remote sensing of water vapor. VIS wind are comparable in\nquality to operational upper-level cloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors\nin regions are lacking in defining moisture structure, though they have the ability to\nobtain track-able information in extremely dry air masses and regions of strong\nsubsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent single level reports; however,\nupper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-spectral observations.\n1. Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed\nretrieval\nThis sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different\nvertical levels as well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity\nof atmospheric jets, the retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in\nthe assigned pressure levels. Based on some standard analysis (e.g. NCEP reanalysis\nof 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a quantitative assessment of the vertical and\nspatial structure of this sensitivity.\n2. Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment\nWe plan to use IMD‚Äôs operational regional model output during height assignment\nprocedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of\nAMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational\nmodel, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM\nwill be generated over the regions not covered by IMD‚Äôs regional model.\n3. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment\nTo use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to\nfind the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may\nincrease the AMV turn-around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway\nto develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 210\nVisible wind vectors\nand water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this\nempirical model will then be used in real-time applications.\n4. Comparison of maximum-correlation and minimum-difference methods\nfor tracking of cloud-tracers.\nThe comparison have been made for a large number of image samples and it was\nfound that the efficiencies of minimum-difference method (MDM) and maximum\ncross correlation (MCC) methods are comparable, while the MDM method is\nsignificantly faster than MCC.\n13.8 References\n1.

Deb, C.M. Kishtawal Mid-Infrared winds Baseline Document\n(Version 1)\n14.2 Introduction\nThe purpose of this document is to present an algorithm for retrieving Mid-Infrared Winds\n(MIR) from INSAT-3D thermal infrared imager channel and its validation procedure. The\nINSAT-3D will have one MIR channel (3.8 ‚Äì 4.0 ÔÅ≠m). In this document some background\nand general characteristic of satellite-derived winds from mid-infrared channels\ncharacteristics; the methodology employed to derive the vector fields, theoretical basis and\npractical aspects of this algorithm and outlined the planned validation approach.\n14.2.1 Overview and background\nSpatio‚Äìtemporal analysis of meteorological events is an important part of routine numerical\nweather analysis. In that context, a cloud tracking method is presented here for a sequence of\ngeostationary satellite images. Given a pair of remotely sensed images, captured at a fixed\ntime interval (typically, 30 min), the objective is to derive motion vectors associated with the\ncloud mass. This correspondence process is a useful precursor to cloud motion vector studies\nand spatio‚Äìtemporal analysis of cloud life cycles. The spatio‚Äìtemporal life cycle includes the\ngeneration, dissipation and assimilation of clouds that can be observed in a sequence of\ngeostationary satellite images. During the 1970‚Äôs and early 1980‚Äôs, cloud motion winds were\nproduced in major operational centers like NESDIS (National Environmental Satellite Data\nand Information Service) using a combination of automated and manual techniques. Early\nautomated techniques supplied quality low-level vectors from mid-infrared channel but often\nyielded in consistent quality for mid- and high-level motions. Height assignment for the mid-\ninfrared winds is done with collocated infrared images using infrared window technique. In\nthe subsequent years, due to the developments in image-processing and pattern recognition\ntechniques (Merill et al., 1991), it was possible to design fully automatic techniques for wind\nretrieval, and NESDIS began its application in 1992. In later time, several new developments\nwere made to make accurate retrievals of winds from satellite images.\nGenerally, atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) wind coverage has been diurnally consistent\nin the mid to upper-levels (100-600 hPa) by the use of 6.7 Œºm water vapor and 10.7 Œºm long-\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 215\nMid infra-red wind vectors\nwave infrared (LWIR) channels. However, in the low-levels (600-950 hPa), AMVs are\nretrieved using a combination of the visible and LWIR channels, depending on the time of\nday. The visible channel provides far superior low-level tracer detection than the LWIR\nchannel. This is due to its finer spatial resolution and decreased susceptibility to attenuation\nby low-level moisture. Unfortunately, nighttime low-level satellite wind coverage typically\ndecreases sharply when visible channel is not available. This creates a situation of overall\nreduced wind information for the user during night-time. Using the mid-infrared (MIR) 3.9\nŒºm channel on the INSAT-3D satellite, MIR cloud-drift winds have been developed to\nprovide improved nighttime low-level satellite wind coverage. The MIR channel is slightly\nmore sensitive to warmer temperatures and less sensitive to thin cirrus than the 10.7 Œºm long-\nwave infrared (LWIR) channel traditionally used to track low-level clouds at night. This\nallows for a higher detectability rate of low-level (600-950 hPa) cloud tracers in the MIR\nchannel. Improved low-level nighttime wind coverage can provide forecasters with more\nwind data as well as reduce the diurnal inconsistencies that may be a challenge to data\nassimilation into models.\n14.2.2 Objective\nThe main objective of this study is to derive the Mid-Infrared Winds (MIR) over sea using\nmultiple successive half hourly MIR images. The region over which the winds are derived\nshould be in the range of 500 from sub-satellite point.\n14.3 Inputs\n14.3.1 Static Data\nParameter Resolution Source\nContinental boundary Data 1 km DP (IMD data)\n14.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and geometric pixel 10 bit -- Derived\ncorrected gray count from raw\nvalues of split window IR data by DP\nchannel (10.5-11.5 ÔÅ≠m and (data\n11.5-12.5 ÔÅ≠m) and MIR processing)\nchannel (3.9 ÔÅ≠m)\n(All the data is required in\nfixed lat-lon grid for\ncontinuous 8-images\nseparated by 30 minutes\ntime interval)\nGray value to brightness - - 0.3 K Derived by\ntemperature conversion DP\ntable\nGeo-location file Pixel - 1 Km Derived by\nDP\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 216\nMid infra-red wind vectors\n14.3.3 Other Auxiliary data and Model Inputs\nParameter Resolution Accuracy Source\nNumerical model forecast\nof wind for all levels 2 m/s\n1 degree or 0.5 (speed) IMD\ndegree 20o\n(direction)\nAll levels model forecast\nTemperature 1o K\n14.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n14.4.1 Overview\n14.4.1.1 Methodology\n14.4.1.1.1 Solar Contamination in MIR Channel\nThe MIIR channel is susceptible to solar contamination during daytime due to its proximity\nto the visible spectrum. Cirrus clouds are somewhat reflective of solar radiation and cumulus\nclouds are highly reflective in the MIR channel. Since low-level cumulus clouds are the main\nsource of targets for low-level cloud-drift winds, this reflectance causes tracking problems\ndue to saturation effects. The reflected solar energy received at the INSAT-3D sensor from\nthe cumulus clouds can make them appear to be warmer than even the underlying ocean\nsurface at times. This makes tracer selection extremely difficult and erroneous. Therefore, the\nusefulness of this channel for winds derivation to be limited to nighttime applications\nbecause of its sensitivity to solar contamination.\n14.4.1.1.2 MIR Image Enhancements\nThe MIR channel is characterized by relatively small gradients in brightness temperatures in\nthe warmer low levels. This limits the ability of the tracking algorithm to detect viable cloud\ntargets and resultant tracers over time. A technique was developed at CIMSS (Velden and\nDunion 2001) to enhance the MIR imagery by stretching the brightness temperature contrast\nin the warmer end of the spectrum (low levels). Specifically, the brightness temperature\nrange from 50-160 is stretched. This enhancement greatly improves the gradients in the low-\nlevels at the cost of confining the mid to upper-level gradients in the image. Therefore, tracer\ndetection is strictly limited to cloud tracers ‚â•600 hPa (based on brightness temperature\ndetermined heights). The image enhancement technique is performed on the MIR images\nused to track the cloud features.\n14.4.1.1.3 Tracer selection\nAt the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS), the initial\ncloud features are selected by locating the highest pixel brightness values for each target\ndomain and computing the local gradients around those locations (Nieman et al., 1997). Any\ngradients greater than 150K are assigned as target locations, and prospective targets also\nundergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter out unwanted\ntargets. Water vapor tracers are generally identified using the local bi-directional gradients in\na template of specified size and compared with empirically determined thresholds to identify\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 217\nMid infra-red wind vectors\nthe features with sufficient variability (Velden et al., 1997) and those that pass the threshold\nvalue are identified as tracers for cloud-free environments. The pixel with maximum bi-\ndirectional gradient is the location of the tracer. At the European Organization for the\nExploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the tracers in the Meteosat (first-\ngeneration satellites) images are selected using multispectral histogram analysis (Tomassini,\n1981), which extracts the dominating scenes in an image segment. Later the selected\ntemplates undergo a spatial coherence analysis (Coakley and Bretherton, 1982) to filter the\nimage, to enhance the upper-level cloud. In the present study the features are selected by\ncomputing local image anomaly in a 32 x 32 template window, both in cloudy regions of the\nmid-infrared images. The local image anomaly is calculated using the following formula:\na ÔÄΩÔÉ•ÔÉ• I(i, j)ÔÄ≠I (1)\ni j\nÔÄ® ÔÄ©\nWhere I i, j represent the grey value for (i, j) pixel of a template window and bar represents\nthe mean of grey values within that template. The anomaly-based tracers are generally\nproduced by a smooth feature field in comparison to the gradient-based features. This\ndifference can help in reducing the tracking errors (Deb et al., 2008).\n14.4.1.1.4 Height assignment\nThe height assignments of the selected tracers selected based on the above criterion are\nderived using the collocated infrared images with the following widely used methods viz.\nsuch as the infrared window (WIN) technique and the cloud base method (LeMarshall, 1993).\nOnce final height is selected a few gross error checks are also applied. A brief description of\neach method is following:\nInfrared Window Channel (WIN):\nIn this method the height assignment using a single satellite channel is made by comparing\neither infrared window brightness temperature (BT) values with NWP model forecast\ntemperature profiles. Cloud heights are determined by interpolating the cloud temperature,\nwhich is an average of coldest 20% of pixels, to the interpolated model guess field at the\ntarget location. A 6-h NWP model forecast from National Center for Environmental\nPrediction (NCEP) Global Forecast System (GFS) is the source of temperature profile. This\nmethod works well with opaque clouds. However, movement of opaque clouds usually does\nnot accurately represent atmospheric motion at the assigned level (Nieman et al., 1993),\nresulting in a lower derived wind speed than observed.\nCloud Base Method (BASE):\nWind speeds for low-level cumulus clouds (cloud top pressures greater than 600 hPa or\naltitudes lower than 600 hPa) have been found to be best represented by the movement at the\ncloud base level instead of the mid or upper levels of the cloud (Hasler et al., 1979). A\nmethod was developed at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (LeMarshall, 1993) to\nestimate this height using the Infrared Window channel. This method first constructs a\nhistogram of the BT values over a selected region surrounding the cloud target being\nexamined. This histogram is then smoothed and Hermite polynomials are fitted to the\nhistogram to separate the distribution into two components; a cloudy and clear sky region.\nAssuming the distributions are normal, the cloud base height can be estimated. The mid\ncloud temperature is determined by examining the second derivative histogram of the cloudy\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 218\nMid infra-red wind vectors\ndistribution, while the cloud top temperature is estimated to be located at the coldest 5% of\nthe cloudy distribution. The cloud base temperature is estimated to be located the same\ndistance from the mid cloud temperature as the cloud top temperature. The calculated cloud\nbase temperature is converted to a pressure using model field interpolated to the target\nlocation. As mentioned previously, this height assignment method is only applied to those\ntargets which are calculated to have a cloud top pressure of greater than 600 hPa (i.e. altitude\nlower than 600 hPa). This \"initial\" target cloud top height is provided by one of the previous\nInfrared Window height assignment methods. The BASE method is used to adjust only these\nwinds, and is not utilized for water vapor winds or winds with pressures less than 600 hPa\n(i.e. altitudes higher than 600 hPa).\nOnce the mid-infrared tracers heights using the above two algorithms have been calculated,\nthe best height among the available heights is determined. The lowest pressure (highest\naltitude) value of all the calculated height values is used as the final pressure height.\nHowever, if for a specific tracer final height is WIN and a valid BASE height is available,\nthen the BASE height is used as the final height.\n14.4.1.1.5 Tracking\nIf a traceable feature is found in the first image and corresponding height of the selected\ntracers are estimated, the match of this template is searched in the second image within a\nbigger ‚Äò‚Äòsearch window‚Äô‚Äô, centered at the same point as the template window. To optimize\nthe search window size, the first guess model wind direction at the tracer location is also\nconsidered. The search area is optimized within ¬±30 degree from the model wind direction at\nthat level of atmosphere. The 32 X 32 template in the second image that lies within the\nsearch window should have the same class as the template in the first image; otherwise the\ntemplate in the second window is rejected. The cross-correlation technique is used\noperationally for tracking the tracer between two images in most operational centers.\nHowever, in this study the degrees of matching between two successive images are\ncalculated by the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) coefficient (E).\nIt is defined as\nn\nÔÉ•ÔÄ®\nI ÔÄ≠I\nÔÄ©2\nt s\nE ÔÄΩ 1 ÔÄ≠ iÔÄΩ1 (2)\nn\nÔÉ•\nÔÄ®\nI ÔÄ≠I\nÔÄ©2\nt t\niÔÄΩ1\nWhere I and I are the variance of the grey values for template window and search window\nt s\nand I is the average of variance of template window. Here n is 32 x 32 and this is the size of\nt\ntemplate window and corresponding template of same size in the searching area. The size of\nthe searching area in the subsequent image is taken as 64 x 64. The coefficient E is\nnormalized to values between ‚ÄìÔÇµ and +1. An efficiency E = 1 corresponds to a perfect match,\nE = 0 means that search window is as accurate as mean of the template window and E < 0\nimplies the lack of matching between template and search window. The closer the model\nefficiency to 1, the more accurate the matching between the windows. A cut-off value of\nE=0.8 is defined, below which a matching of target is not considered. The Nash-Sutcliffe\nmodel efficiency coefficient (E) is normalized and its value lies between -ÔÇ• and 1, towards\nthe higher end (e.g. as E ÔÉ† 1.0), the value of E approaches r2, where r is the correlation\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 219\nMid infra-red wind vectors\ncoefficient. Thus a value of E=1 is exactly equivalent to a correlation of 1.0 between two\nobjects. The maximum value of E is chosen as the best fit for tracking. One of the main\nadvantages of this matching technique is that it reduces the possibility of multiple maxima,\nbecause the parameter E has a higher sensitivity to differences between two features\ncompared to maximum cross correlation coefficient (MCC). Thus, when the degree of\nmismatch between two objects increases, the value of E falls more sharply compared to that\nof MCC, making E a better index for matching two objects. The application of this tracking\nmethod in estimation of water vapor winds has shown some improvement over Indian Ocean\nregion (Deb et al., 2008).\n14.4.1.1.6 Wind buffer generation and Quality control\nQuality indicator of a derived wind vectors is traditionally represented as the degree of the\ncoherence of a given vector with its surrounding. In most of the operational centers the\nAMVs are derived from three successive satellite images and the quality control of the\nretrieved winds are done either through Quality Indicator (QI) (Holmlund, 1998) followed at\nEUMETSAT or through 3-dimensional recursive filter function followed at NESDIS\n(Nieman et al., 1997) or both the algorithms together. In the present study a new technique of\nwind buffer generation and subsequently QI procedure followed at EUMETSAT is proposed.\nIn this technique, a wind buffer is created using previous eight images between a pair of\nimages (viz. between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6-7 and 7-8) and stored in a file (Fig. 1). The\nprevious eight images were considered to maintain the minimum 4-hour decorrelation\ntimescale during retrieval (Kaur et al., 2011). In quality control procedure consists of a\ncoherence analysis which forms the basis for acceptance/rejection of a vector and degree of\ncoherence computed is used to assign quality flags to the derived vector. The value of quality\nflag falls sharply by an exponential function, as the disagreement of a given vector with its\nsurroundings increases. Here each vector wind is represented by a complex\nnumberVc ÔÄΩu ÔÄ´iv . For every new vector under consideration, (from current image-\ni,j i,j i,j\npair), its vector difference from the buffer is computed at the same as well as 3 X 3\nneighborhood (Fig. 1), provided, the vectors to be compared show similar brightness\ncharacteristics (to maintain the similar height).\nFig 1: A schematic diagram of quality control process.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 220\nMid infra-red wind vectors\nHere X (cross sign) at the centre of first box represents the current vector under consideration\nand O (circle sign) represents spatial and temporal neighborhood vectors. The vector\ndifferences (magnitude of complex numbers) are calculated as ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ ÔÄΩVc ÔÄ≠ ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ . Here\ndif i,j,t i,j,t\nVc represents the current vector at (i, j) point and ÔÅª V ÔÅΩ neighborhood vectors with\ni,j,t\nÔÄ≠1ÔÇ£i ÔÇ£1,ÔÄ≠1ÔÇ£ j ÔÇ£1 and temporal scale t varies from 1 to 8. If all spatial and temporal\nneighborhood vectors are present, then the difference set will contain 72 vectors (9 spatial\nneighborhoods with 8 temporal scales). However, all vectors may not be there all the times.\nThe quality control process begins if at least 10 vector differencesV , excluding the\ndif\ndifference corresponding to current (i, j), are present in the set. In the next step, set of vector\nÔÅª ÔÅΩ\ndifferences V is arranged in ascending order. The quality control process begins is the\ndif\naverage of 10 V is greater than 2.5 m/s. In the next step, the QI value for each vector is\ndif\ndetermined by using EUMETSAT procedure where four different tests are performed, which\nis normalized by a tanh-function that returns the value between 0 and 1. A weighted average\nof these individual quality indicators is then used for screening of poor quality vectors from\nfinal output. If any vector is not present in the immediate two pairs, then in-stead of rejecting,\nsearch process goes to the previous time steps of the wind buffer and if still it is not present it\ngoes to next previous times steps and so on.\nIf S is the mean ‚Äúspeed‚Äù of a vector computed from two pair of images, then different\nquality functions are computed as below :\nDirection Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑÔÅ± ÔÉπ 1\nDCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nA exp(ÔÄ≠S/B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n1 1 1\nSpeed Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑS ÔÉπ 2\nSCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n2 2 2\nVector Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑV ÔÉπ 3\nVCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n3 3 3\nSpacial Consistency Function:\nD\nÔÉ© ÔÅÑV ÔÉπ 4\nPCF ÔÄΩ1.0ÔÄ≠\nÔÉ™\ntanh( m )\nÔÉ∫\nMAX(A S,B )ÔÄ´C\nÔÉ´ ÔÉª\n4 4 2\nIn the above formulation, ÔÅÑÔÅ±,ÔÅÑS,ÔÅÑV represent the difference of direction (degrees),\ndifference of speed, and the length of the difference vector between first and second satellite\nwind component.

The best neighbor is determined by the smallest vector difference.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 221\nMid infra-red wind vectors\nQuantities A B ,C , and D are constants. The final quality indicator of a wind vector is\nN, N N N\ngiven as\nDCF ÔÄ´SCF ÔÄ´VCF ÔÄ´PCF\nQI =\n4.0\nAll the vectors with QI < 0.6 are rejected.\nIn the conventional triplet based methodology requires that a vector is available in both sets\n(i.e. in 1-2 and 2-3), if not so, such vectors are rejected, because they don‚Äôt get ‚Äúsupport‚Äù.\nHundreds of ‚Äúisolated‚Äù vectors thus get eliminated, even though they represent the real\nsituation. In the current method, the vector under consideration receives support from the\npast eight images. This method produces higher number of valid retrieval in the low-level\nand captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently. To explain this more explicitly,\nif we take eight satellite images each with 30-minute interval stating at 00:00 UTC to 03:30\nUTC, then winds retrieved using each-image pair are stored as buffer in a file and\nrepresented as wind buffer generated at 03:30 UTC. The buffer generated at 03:30 UTC is\nused for quality control for wind retrieved using 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images and the\nsecond image time is given as actual observation time of retrieved wind. For example winds\nretrieved using 03:30 UTC wind buffer and 03:30 UTC and 04:00 UTC images is given as\n04:00 UTC observation time. As a whole to complete the process once it requires nine\nimages. Similarly the buffer is updated at every 30-minute with the latest available image and\nprocess is repeated for next cycle of wind retrieval. This method produces higher number of\nvalid retrieval in all levels and captures upper-level meridional flow very prominently.\n14.4.2 Operational Implementation\n14.4.2.1 Step 1: Tracer selection from image\nÔÇ∑ Cloud tracer selection will be done by evaluating the local image anomaly\nsurrounding each pixel in the target array and selecting the maximum brightness\ntemperature of the window.\n14.4.2.2 Step 2: Height assignment\nÔÇ∑ Assign height of the selected tracer using IR window technique.

Quantitative assessment of the MIR winds product is possible from statistical\nanalyses and impact on NWP. The traditional method of validation is matching\nobservations with collocated radiosondes. The statistical validation will be done according\nto the CGMS winds evaluation reporting guidelines.

At the CGMS XXIII the Working Group on\nSatellite Tracked Winds recommended that evaluation of operational wind production\nquality should be accomplished with a new standardized reporting method. The\nrecommended three parts of the report.\ni) Monthly means of speed bias and rms vector difference between radiosondes and\nsatellite winds for low (>700 hPa), medium (700-400 hPa), and high (< 400 hPa) levels\ntogether with the radiosonde mean wind speed. This should be done for three latitude\nbands: north of 20 N, the tropical belt (20 N to 20 S), and south of 20 S.\nii) Trends of the evaluation statistics for the monthly cloud motion vectors and water\nvapor motion vectors through the last 12 months.\niii) Information on recent significant changes in the wind retrieval algorithm.\nThe vector Difference (VD) between an individual wind report (i) and the collocated\nradiosonde report used for verification is given by\n(VD) = [ (Ui ‚Äì Ur)2 + (Vi ‚Äì Vr)2 ]1/2\nThe speed bias is given by\nN\n(BIAS)i = 1/N ‚àë [( Ui2 + V i2 )1/2 - (Ur2 + Vr2 )1/2 ]\ni=1\nThe mean vector difference (MVD) traditionally reported is\nN\n(MVD) = 1/N ‚àë (VD)i\ni=1\nAnd the standard deviation (SD) about the mean vector difference traditionally\nreported is\nN\n(SD) = [1/N ‚àë ( (Vdi) ‚Äì (MVD) )2 ]1/2\nI=1\nThe root-mean-square error (RMSE) traditionally reported is the square root of the sum\nof the squares of the mean vector difference and the standard deviation about the mean\nvector difference,\n(RMSE) = [ (MVD)2 + (SD)2 ]1/2\nIt must be noted that this definition of the mean vector difference is not the same as the\nmean component difference. The mean difference is calculated from the sum of the\nsquares of the deviations of each component (u and v) of the wind vector.\nN\n(‚àÜU2) = ‚àë (Ui ‚ÄìUr)2\ni=1\nN\n(‚àÜV2) = ‚àë (Vi ‚ÄìVr)2\ni=1\n(MCD) = [ (‚àÜU2) + (‚àÜV2) ]1/2 ‚â† (MVD)\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 224\nMid infra-red wind vectors\nTo avoid confusion, a common terminology will be accepted. It is suggested to report mean\nvector difference (MVD) and standard deviation (SD). The standard accuracy according to\nCGMS guideline for CMV is that the root mean square error (RMSE) for WV winds should\nbe 7m/s respectively with respect to radiosonde observations. The mean bias for both sets of\nwinds should be about zero.\n14.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the registration of the images. If the\nregistration has an error of 1 pixel, then error of the final product will be increased. However\nthe following limitations of the present study have to be kept in mind. The spatially coherent,\nhigh resolution coverage of upper tropospheric winds is possible from geostationary satellite\nremote sensing of water vapor. MIR wind is comparable in quality to operational upper-level\ncloud-motion vectors. However, the retrieved vectors in regions are lacking in defining\nmoisture structure, though they have the ability to obtain track-able information in extremely\ndry air masses and regions of strong subsidence is limited. The individual vectors represent\nsingle level reports; however, upper level vertical winds profiles are possible by using multi-\nspectral observations.\n1. Sensitivity of error in height assignment to the error in wind speed retrieval\nThis sensitivity will depend upon the structure of wind circulation over different\nvertical levels as well as different geographical regions. For example, in the vicinity\nof atmospheric jets, the retrieved wind vectors will be highly sensitive to the errors in\nthe assigned pressure levels. Based on some standard analysis (e.g. NCEP reanalysis\nof 6-hourly sampling), we will provide a quantitative assessment of the vertical and\nspatial structure of this sensitivity.\n2.Numerical model to be used for AMV height assignment\nWe plan to use IMD‚Äôs operational regional model output during height assignment\nprocedure. However, if the domain of this regional model is smaller than the area of\nAMV retrieval, either IMD may be requested to increase the domain of its operational\nmodel, or a lower-quality solution based on the output of coarser-resolution GCM\nwill be generated over the regions not covered by IMD‚Äôs regional model.\n3. Whether RT model to be used in real-time for height assignment\nTo use RT model in real-time height-assignment application is generally required to\nfind the optimum solution. However, it is computationally expensive and may\nincrease the AMV turn-around time very significantly. Efforts are currently underway\nto develop an empirical version of RT model that can be used for simulation of IR\nand water-vapor channel radiances for a variety of cloud heights. The inverse of this\nempirical model will then be used in real-time applications.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 225\nMid infra-red wind vectors\n4.

K. Thapliyal\nM. V. Shukla UTH Baseline Document\nShivani Shah\n15.2 Introduction\nUpper Tropospheric Humidity (UTH) is an estimate of the mean relative humidity of the\natmosphere between approximately 600 hPa and 300 hPa. UTH is basically a measure of\nweighted mean of relative humidity according to the weighting function of the water\nvapour channel. Therefore, UTH is more likely a representative of the relative humidity\naround the atmospheric layer where weighting function of water vapour channel peaks\n15.2.1 Overview and background\nUpper tropospheric humidity from satellite measurements is useful to monitor changes in\nwater vapour in the upper troposphere on a global and regional scale. Several methods\nhave been developed for retrieving UTH from water vapour channel measurements\n(Schmetz and Turpeinen, 1988; Soden and Bretherton, 1993, 1996; Stephens et al, 1996).\nChanges in relative humidity around this layer would contribute maximum to the changes\nin the radiances received in this channel.\nUTH extraction is in principle the calculation of single-column values for the upper\ntropospheric humidity. The physics involved is the quantitative description of the transfer\nof the WV channel radiances from the radiation emitting surface through the atmosphere\ntowards the satellite as calculated by radiative transfer model. The transfer calculations\nare performed for a set of different constant humidity values for the upper tropospheric\natmosphere for standard atmosphere representing different months/seasons. Empirical\ncoefficients generated for different months are then used to derive from the IR and WV\nradiation measured by the satellite to estimate an average of the upper tropospheric\nhumidity that caused the emitted radiation to be attenuated to the values measured. Only\nthe pixels of surface and low cloud clusters are used, excluding the pixels of\ncontamination with medium and high cloud clusters from the processing.\n15.2.2 Objective\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 231\nUpper tropospheric humidity\nIn this project the algorithm will be developed for computing Upper Tropospheric\nHumidity (UTH) from WV channels 6.7 ÔÅ≠m of VHRR onboard Kalpana ‚Äì1, INSAT-3A\nand Imager onboard future INSAT-3D satellite.\n15.3 Inputs\n15.3.1 Static Data\nParameter Resolution Accuracy Source\nAtmospheric profile - - TIGR-3 data base\n(2311) of Temperature, (Chevallier, Che¬¥din,\nWater Vapour, Ozone Che¬¥ruy, & Morcrette, 2000)\n41 diverse profiles of - - ECMWF\ntemperature, water\nvapour, Ozone\nSeeBor dataset of diverse - - Seeman and Borbas,\nprofiles (~12000) CIMSS/SSEC\n15.3.2 Image and preprocessing data (Dynamic)\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and Pixel 10bit - Derived from\ngeometric corrected raw data by\ngray count values of DP (data\nWV channel#2 (5.7- processing)\n7.1ÔÅ≠) of INSAT-\n3A/Kalpana and\nChannel#4 (6.5-7.1ÔÅ≠)\nof INSAT-3D Imager\nRadiometric and pixel 10 bit - Derived from\ngeometric corrected raw data by\ngray count values of DP\nTIR channel#3 (10.5-\n12.5ÔÅ≠) for INSAT-\n3A/Kalpana and Imager\nChannel#5 (10.2-11.3ÔÅ≠)\nfor INSAT-3D\nCoefficients for - - - Derived by\nconversion of Gray DP\nvalue to radiances\nGeolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel Derived by\nDP\n15.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 232\nUpper tropospheric humidity\n15.4.1 Overview\nStandard tropical atmospheric profile has been used to simulate VHRR radiances using\nSBDART model. Filter response function for the INSAT-3A/ Kalpana-1 WV channel\nwas provided as input to the SABDART. Standard profile was modified by replacing\nspecific humidity at levels above 600 hPa to represent constant relative humidty ranging\nfrom 2 to 100% with the interval of 2%. Satellite zenith angle was varied from 0 to 75\ndegrees at an interval of 5 degree for each constant relative humidity profile. Radiances\nwere simulated for each set of profile and zenith angle at the top of atmosphere (100 km)\nfrom SBDART for VHRR WV channel. Brightness temperature is computed from\nsimulated radiances using the following relationship:\nTb = A/ ln{(B/R) + 1}\n6.7\nWhere, A and B are constants, Tb is Brightness Temperature in K and R is Radiance in\nmW/cm2/Sr/¬µ.\nA bilinear regression relationship is established between ln{uth/cos(ÔÅ±)}\nvapour channel brightness temperature Tb in the form:\n6.7\nLn{UTH/cos(ÔÅ±)}= a + b.Tb ---- (1)\n6.7\nWhere, ÔÅ± is the satellite zenith angle of the corresponding pixel, and a and b are the\nregression coefficients. We obtain the following relationship for the UTH with satellite\nzenith angle and measured brightness temperature (Fig.1):\nUTH = cos(ÔÅ±) * exp(-a * Tb + b ) for Tb < 240.0 ----- (2a)\n1 6.7 1 6.7\n(with R2 = 0.9965)\nAnd,\nUTH = cos(ÔÅ±) * exp(-a * Tb + b ) for TbWV > 240.0 ----- (2b)\n2 6.7 2\n(with R2 = 0.9989)\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 233\nUpper tropospheric humidity\nINSAT-3A/ Kalpana WV brightness temperature (TbWV) vs\nUpper Tropospheric relative humidity (UTH)\n6\n5 Ln{UTH/cos(zen)} = -0.165*TbWV + 42.96\nR2 = 0.9965 (for TbWV < 240.0)\n4\n}\n)\nn\ne\nz\n(\ns\no\nc 3\nH/\nT\nU\n{\nn\nL\n2\n1\nLn{UTH/cos(zen)} = -0.133*TbWV + 35.32\nR2 = 0.9989 (for TbWV > 240.0)\n0\n225 230 235 240 245 250 255 260 265\nTbWV\nFig.1 INSAT WV Brightness Temperature vs UTH\nThe algorithm uses water vapour channel of the INSAT-3A/Kalpana-1 VHRR (5.7-7.1ÔÅ≠)\nto estimate the upper tropospheric humidity in absence of middle and upper level clouds.\nThe generation of the UTH product is directly based on the WV brightness temperatures.\nEach water vapour image is converted into different segments of 16 x 16 pixels as the\naveraging would reduce the error in measurements and also helps removes the pixels with\npartial cloud cover. The WV image pixels of each segment not belonging to\ncontamination with medium and high cloud clusters are averaged (if there are any,\notherwise no UTH value is derived for such a segment). Presently, pixels with middle and\nupper clouds are removed using a threshold value of IR brightness temperature of 270 K.\nAdditionally, if UTH value exceeds 110%, then pixel is assumed to be cloud\ncontaminated. However, this approach needs further modification. These segment WV\nbrightness temperatures are used to derive an upper tropospheric relative humidity by\nusing the empirical relation (2).\nBrightness temperatures depend strongly upon the satellite zenith angle since it increases\nthe path length for the radiances reaching the satellite. Therefore, zenith angle is\ncomputed for each segment to be used with the regression equation. Satellite zenith\nangles are computed for every pixel using satellite-observer geometry using the following\nformula:\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 234\nUpper tropospheric humidity\nÔÅ¢ = (ÔÅ∞/2) ‚Äì arc cos[sin(ÔÅ®)/sin(ÔÅ≤)] --- (3)\nwhere,\nÔÅ≤=arc sin[R /(R +H)]\ne e\nÔÅ®=arc tan[sin(ÔÅ≤)*sin(ÔÅ¨)/(1-sin(ÔÅ≤)*cos(ÔÅ¨)]\nÔÅ¨=arc cos[sin(ÔÅ§ )*sin(ÔÅ§ )+cos(ÔÅ§ )*cos(ÔÅ§ )*cos(ÔÅÑL)]\nS T S T\nR = radius of Earth = 6378.16 km\ne\nH = Altitude of satellite = 36000 km\nÔÅÑL = | L ‚Äì L |\nS T\n(ÔÅ§ ,L ) is latitude and longitude of the target\nT T\n(ÔÅ§ ,L ) is latitude and longitude of the sub-satellite point\nS S\n15.4.2 Theoretical Background\nIn general a satellite sensor observes the total radiances in a spectral interval, which exits\nthe atmosphere in the direction of the satellite sensor.

The computation of radiative transfer within a cloudy\natmosphere requires knowledge of the scattering efficiency, the single scattering albedo,\nand the asymmetry factor, which indicates the strength of forward scattering. SBDART\ncontains an internal database of these parameters for clouds computed with a Mie\nscattering code and covers a range of particle size effective radius in the range 2 to\n128um. By default, the angular distribution of scattered photons is based on the simple\nHenyey-Greenstein parameterization, but more detailed scattering functions may be input\nas desired.\nGas Absorption Model: Standard SBDART uses low-resolution band models developed\nfor the LOWTRAN 7 atmospheric transmission code (Pierluissi and Marogoudakis,\n1986). These models provide the clear sky atmospheric transmisson from 0 to 50000 cm-1\nand include the effects of all radiatively active molecular species found in the earth's\natmosphere. The models were derived from detailed line-by-line calculations, which were\ndegraded to 20 cm-1 resolutions for use in LOWTRAN. This translates to a wavelength\nresolution of about 5 nm in the visible and about 200 nm in the thermal infrared. A\ncapability to read high-resolution k-distribution optical depths from a disk file is\nintroduced in SBDART version 2.0 which is less convenient to use than the standard\napproach. However, it has the advantage of removing limitations in the ultimate spectral\nresolution available with SBDART.\nExtraterrestrial Source Spectra: SBDART has options for three extraterrestrial solar\nspectrum models: LOWTRAN-7 solar spectrum (Shettle and Fenn, 1975), solar models\nused in 5s (Tanre, 1988) or MODTRAN-3 solar spectrum.\nStandard Atmospheric Models: SBDART has six standard atmospheric profiles from\nthe 5s atmospheric radiation code to model the following typical climatic conditions:\ntropical, midlatitude summer, midlatitude winter, subarctic summer, subarctic winter and\nUS62. These model atmospheres (McClatchey et al, 1971) have been widely used in the\natmospheric research community and provide standard vertical profiles of pressure,\ntemperature, water vapor and ozone density. Optionally users can specify their own\nmodel atmosphere, e.g, a radiosonde profile. The concentration of trace gases such as\nCO or CH are assumed to make up a fixed fraction (which may be specified by the\n2 4\nuser) of the total particle density.\nStandard Aerosol Models: SBDART can compute the radiative effects of several\ncommon boundary layer and upper atmosphere aerosol types. In the boundary layer, the\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 236\nUpper tropospheric humidity\nuser can select from rural, urban, or maritime aerosols. The total vertical optical depth of\nboundary layer aerosols is derived from user specified horizontal meteorologic visibility\nat 0.55 ¬µm and an internal vertical distribution model. In the upper atmosphere up to 5\naerosol layers can be specified, with radiative characteristics that model fresh and aged\nvolcanic, meteoric and the climatological tropospheric background aerosols. The aerosol\nmodels included in SBDART were derived from those provided in the 5s and\nLOWTRAN7.\nRadiative Transfer Equation Solver: The radiative transfer equation is numerically\nintegrated with DISORT (DIScreet Ordinate Radiative Transfer, Stamnes et al, 1988).\nThe discrete ordinate method provides a numerically stable algorithm to solve the\nequations of plane-parallel radiative transfer in a vertically inhomogeneous atmosphere.\nThe intensity of both scattered and thermally emitted radiation can be computed at\ndifferent heights and directions. SBDART is configured to allow up to 65 atmospheric\nlayers and 40 radiation streams (40 zenith angles and 40 azimuthal modes).\nSurface Models: The ground surface cover is an important determinant of the overall\nradiation environment. In SBDART six basic surface types -- ocean water, lake water,\nvegetation, snow and sand are used to parameterize the spectral reflectivity of the surface.\nThe spectral reflectivity of a large variety of surface conditions is well approximated by\ncombinations of these basic types. For example, the fractions of vegetation, water and\nsand can be adjusted to generate a new spectral reflectivity representing new/old growth,\nor deciduous vs. evergreen forest. Combining a small fraction of the spectral reflectivity\nof water with that of sand yields an overall spectral dependence close to wet soil.\nThe diverse profiles datasets are used to construct monthly average temperature and\nhumidity profiles over INSAT observation area. Monthly averaged profiles are used to\nminimize the uncertainties due to seasonal variation of upper tropospheric temperature on\nUTH computation. For each month the average profile is perturbed by replacing water\nvapour at each levels between 600-200 hPa to make the relative humidity (RH) a constant\nvalue (=2, 4, 6‚Ä¶.100%) throughout the layer 600-200hPa and falls off linearly to ~0\nfrom 200 hPa to 100 hPa in each of the perturbed profiles. Temperature and ozone\nprofiles are kept same for each perturbed profile in each month and only water vapour is\nchanged above 600 hPa level. Since each level between 600-200hPa has same RH value,\nthe weighted average value, i.e. UTH is equal to RH for each perturbed profile. Water\nvapour channel brightness temperatures for each perturbed profile at different zenith\nangle (0, 5, 10‚Ä¶..60¬∞) are simulated using the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric\nRadiative Transfer (SBDART) model (Ricchiazzi, Yang, Gautier, & Sowle, 1998). The\nradiative transfer computations are carried out separately for each satellite (INSAT-3A,\nKalpana, and INSAT-3D) using sensor response functions of water vapour channels for\nsimulating realistic satellite radiances. For each profile, the main inputs for the radiative\ntransfer computations are: atmospheric profiles of temperature, water vapour, and ozone\nconcentrations. These simulations are carried out for average profiles corresponding to\ndifferent months. Regression analysis is carried out separately for each satellite and each\nmonths independently and the regression coefficients are obtained between\n[UTH/cos(ÔÅ±)] and water vapour channel brightness temperature, where ÔÅ± is zenith angle.\nThese coefficients may be used to retrieve the UTH from satellite observations of water\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 237\nUpper tropospheric humidity\nvapour channel by choosing appropriate coefficient represent the particular satellite and\nmonth of observation.\n15.4.2.2 Flow Chart\nINSAT/Kalpana\nIR and WV data\nfiles\nConversion from Look-up table file\nGrey count to (calibration table)\nBrightness Temp.\nCloud detection\n(Elimination of cloudy\npixel by threshold)\nBT > 270 & UTH < 110\nir\n&\nno. of cloudy pixel < 75% of\nthe box\nCalculate zenith\nangle\nGeolocation file UTH retrieval UTH coefficient\n(satellite, month)\nUTH.dat\nASCII file\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 238\nUpper tropospheric humidity\n15.4.3 Operational Implementation\n15.4.2.1 Step 1 : Conversion of Grey count to Brightness temperature :\nThe grey count values in the IR and WV geo-corrected files are converted into the\nbrightness temperature values using the static look-up table file, which is generated\nduring characterization of the instruments on the ground before launch. This LUT file is\nprovided along with the data set.\n15.4.2.2 Step 2 : Cloud detection:\nAll the data in the cold space and data falling beyond the 60ÔÇ∞ radius from the sub-satellite\npoints are excluded from further calculations. Cloudy pixels are identified and these\npixels are also excluded from further calculations. The threshold used to eliminate the\ncloudy pixel is that if brightness temperature of thermal IR window channel is less than\nor equal to 270 and if the UTH calculated at that pixel is > 110 then it is a cloudy pixel,\nand hence eliminated. In the 5 x 5 pixel box, if the number of cloudy pixels is more than\n75 % than the whole box is considered as cloudy and excluded from UTH retrieval.\n15.4.2.3 Step 3: Zenith angle calculation:\nAfter the cloudy pixels are discarded then the zenith angle is calculated for the pixels\nusing Equation (3).\n15.4.2.4 Step 4 : UTH retrieval:\nUsing the above calculated zenith angle and the UTH coefficients for corresponding\nsatellite and month of the observation, UTH is calculated from Equation (2) using the\nwater vapour channel brightness temperature. UTH is generated for every 5 x 5 pixel box.\n15.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nUTH % 0 100 5 %\n(RMSE) 0.5¬∞ X 0.5¬∞\n15.5.1 Format of the output and the domain\nBinary file giving details of the time and location of the retrieval, zenith angle, % of clear\npixels used in averaging within 5 x 5 pixel box, and UTH (%).\nDomain: 50 S to 50 N, 30 E to 130 E\n15.6 Validation\n15.6.1 Data required\nThe following data can be used for comparison and validation of UTH\nData Resolution Source\nUTH EUMETSAT\nHumidity Profile Radiosonde observations IMD\nHumidity Profile 1 X 1 deg NCEP Reanalysis\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 239\nUpper tropospheric humidity\n15.6.2 Methods of validation\nRadiosonde profiles and NCEP analysis profiles of water vapour are converted into upper\ntropospheric humidity (UTH) estimates using water vapour channel weighting function of\nthe satellite concerned. UTH is weighted average of relative humidity weighted by the\nwater vapour weighting function at each atmospheric level. These estimates of observed\nUTH are compared with the collocated satellite retrieved UTH.\nThese estimates of UTH can also be compared with retrieved product of Meteosat\nsatellite located over Indian Ocean region. Because the extracted UTH product is\ndependent on the WV channel calibration, these UTH/radiosonde comparisons may also\nprovide a method of checking the actual WV calibration coefficients. Brightness\ntemperature observations of satellite WV channels may also be used with simulated\nbrightness temperature from collocated radiosonde profile to compute the bias correction\ncoefficients in the RT model.\n15.7 Technical issues ( limitation etc.)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiation model to simulate the\nsatellite radiances. However the following limitations of the present study have to be kept\nin mind.\ni) It is assumed that upper tropospheric temperature does not deviate by a large\namount from the mean monthly profile.\nii) Satellite receives only a negligible amount of radiance emitted from layers beneath\n600 hPa. The atmosphere above 200 hPa is represented by decreasing the relative\nhumidity to 0% at 100 hPa, which seems to be a reasonable assumption consistent\nwith the structure of standard profiles and observations.\niii) The reason for using mean monthly profiles of water vapour at lower levels as\ninput to the radiative transfer model is that these levels contribute very little to the\noutgoing radiance.\n15.8 Future Scope\nThese coefficients can be improved with the availability of more accurate radiation\nmodels in future. UTH algorithm in future may include the upper tropospheric mean\ntemperature derived from model forecast to minimize the uncertainties due to the\ntemperature variations in the 600-200 hPa layer.\n15.9 References\n1.

INSAT-3D Sounder\nchannels are similar to those in GOES-12 Sounder and many of the spectral bands are similar\nto High resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) onboard NOAA-ATOVS. Hence,\npresent algorithm for INSAT-3D Sounder is adapted from the operational HIRS and GOES\nalgorithms developed by Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies (CIMSS),\nUniversity of Wisconsin.\nThis module also describes the background to retrieval problem, theoretical basis of the\nretrieval algorithm for vertical profiles, practical aspects of algorithm implementation, and\noutline of the planned validation approach. INSAT-3D Sounder instrument characteristics are\ngiven in the appendix-1 at the end.\n16.2.1 Overview and Background:\nINSAT-3D Sounder observations will provide vertical profiles of temperature and humidity\nin clear-sky conditions besides total column ozone and various other derived products.\nAtmospheric profile retrieval algorithm for INSAT-3D Sounder is a two-step approach. The\nfirst step includes generation of accurate hybrid first guess profiles using combination of\nstatistical regression retrieved profiles and model forecast profiles. The second step is\nnonlinear physical retrieval to improve the resulting first guess profile using Newtonian\niterative method.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 245\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\nThe retrievals will be performed using clear sky radiances measured by Sounder within a 5x5\nfield of view (approximately 50 km resolution) over land and ocean for both day and night.\nFour sets of regression coefficients will be generated. Two sets for land and ocean daytime\nconditions and the other two sets for land and ocean night-time conditions using a training\ndataset comprising historical radiosonde observations representing atmospheric conditions\nover INSAT-3D observation region.\nThe retrieval algorithm discussed here is adapted from CIMSS algorithm for GOES-Sounder\nand is primarily based on the retrieval algorithms of Li et al. (2000), Ma et al. (1999), Smith\nand Woolf (1988) and Hayden (1988). Temperature and moisture profiles at Sounder\nresolution are required for numerical weather prediction in short to medium range besides\nvarious other weather and climate applications. High temporal resolution of sounding data\nfrom geostationary satellite INSAT-3D will provide a wealth of new information on\natmospheric structure in clear-sky conditions. Retrieval of atmospheric profiles at high\nspatial and temporal resolutions will immensely improve mesoscale prediction.\n16.2.2 History of atmospheric sounding\nKing (1956) was first to suggest that atmospheric temperature profiles could be inferred from\nsatellite observations of thermal infrared emission and explained the feasibility of retrieving\nthe temperature profile from the satellite intensity scan measurements. Further advances were\nmade for the temperature-sounding concept when Kaplan demonstrated (1959) that vertical\nprofile of temperature could be inferred from the spectral distribution of emission by\natmospheric gases. He suggested that observations in the wings of a spectral band sense\ndeeper regions of the atmosphere; whereas observations in the band center see only the very\ntop layer of the atmosphere. Thus by properly selecting a set of sounding spectral channels at\ndifferent wavelengths in the absorption band, the observed radiances could be used to\nestimate the vertical temperature profile in the atmosphere.\nFollowing a proposal by Wark (1961) for satellite vertical sounding program to measure\natmospheric temperature profiles, the first satellite-sounding instrument (SIRS-A) was\nlaunched on NIMBUS-3 in 1969 (Wark et al., 1970). NOAA launched the TIROS\nOperational Vertical Sounder in 1978 (TOVS, Smith et al. 1979), consisting of High-\nresolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS), Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU), and the\nStratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) onboard satellites NOAA-6 to NOAA-14. HIRS provides\n17 km spatial resolution at nadir with 19 infrared sounding channels (4-15ÔÅ≠), whereas MSU\nprovides 109 km resolution at nadir with 4 microwave channels (~50 GHz). SSU has 3\nchannels in the far IR (~15ÔÅ≠) for stratospheric measurements. Current NOAA series satellites\nNOAA-15 and NOAA-16 (and future satellite in the NOAA series) have ATOVS with\nHIRS/3, and MSU and SSU have been replaced by AMSU-A and AMSU-B to improve the\ntemperature and humidity sounding. HIRS/3 has the same spectral bands as the HIRS/2.\nAMSU-A uses 15 microwave channels around 23, 30, 50 and 90 GHz of oxygen absorption\nbands with resolution of 50 km at nadir. AMSU-B uses 5 microwave channels around 90,\n150 and 190 GHz with a horizontal resolution of 17 km at nadir.\nNew generation of infrared atmospheric sounder is the hyper-spectral sounder with thousands\nof channels instead of few tens of infrared bands. Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder (AIRS)\nonboard EOS-Aqua satellite was launched on May 4, 2002 and is providing a wealth of\nhighly accurate atmospheric and surface information using 2378 high-spectral-resolution\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 246\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\ninfrared (3.7 ‚Äì 15.4 ÔÅ≠) channels with horizontal resolution of 10 km at nadir. AIRS along\nwith AMSU forms a state-of-art atmospheric sounding tool for temperature profiles with\naccuracy of 1 ÔÇ∞C in a 1 km thick layer and humidity profile with an accuracy of 20% in 2 km\nthick layer in the troposphere. Aqua satellite also has MODIS with very high spatial\nresolution of 1 km and is providing the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity.\nRecently, METOP satellite was launched carrying a hyper-spectral sounder IASI onboard\nwith > 8400 channels and mission objective to achieve the temperature and humidity profiles\naccuracy of 1ÔÇ∞C and 10% in 1 km and 2km layers, respectively.\nThe first sounding instrument in geostationary orbit was the GOES VISSR Atmospheric\nSounder (VAS, Smith et al. 1981) launched in 1980. This was followed by GOES-8 Sounder\n(Menzel and Purdom, 1994) that provides 8 km spatial resolution with 18 infrared sounding\nchannels. Current satellite of this series, GOES-13, is launched recently in May 2006. Future\nsatellite GOES-R of this series to be launched in 2012 will have a Hyperspectral\nEnvironmental Suite (HES) to provide high spectral resolution in the infrared and a high\nspatial resolution mode for mesoscale sounding capability. Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI)\nonboard GOES-R will be similar to the current polar orbiting EOS-MODIS. NASA and\nNOAA are planning to launch Geostationary Imaging Fourier Transform Spectrometer\n(GIFTS) that will revolutionize our ability to measure, understand and predict the earth-\natmosphere system.\n16.2.3 Objective\nObjective of the present module is to describe the algorithms and different aspects associated\nwith the retrieval of temperature, humidity profiles and total column ozone from INSAT-3D\nSounder observation in 18 infrared spectral bands.

INSAT-3D\nSounder retrieval scheme involves two-step approach. In first step, first-guess temperature\nand humidity profiles are derived based on regression retrieval combined with model\nforecast. In the second step, accurate temperature and humidity profiles are retrieved based\non physical retrieval procedure that uses non-linear Newtonian iterative method to adjust first\nguess profiles. Ozone profile and integrated amount is retrieved using regression retrieval\nand used as first guess for the physical retrieval routine.\n16.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\nAtmospheric sounding is one of the most important applications of satellite measurements in\nmeteorology, which involves retrieving vertical profiles of temperature and trace-gas\nconcentrations, especially water vapor and ozone, using observations at wavelengths that\nhave significant attenuation in atmosphere. For this we need to know the variation of\ntemperature with altitude, and the variation of the density of atmospheric gases with altitude,\nsuch as carbon dioxide, water vapor and ozone. Water vapor is important because of its\nmeteorological impact and its importance for atmospheric correction in thermal infrared\nmeasurements.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 248\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\nAtmospheric sounding techniques exploit all three phenomena that that play important role in\nradiative transfer: namely absorption, scattering and thermal emission. Most observations are\nmade in the thermal infrared and microwave bands. At infrared wavelengths scattering due to\natmospheric gases is negligible, hence it is not considered in the radiative transfer process.\nFor vertical sounding at infrared wavelengths the significant terms in the radiative transfer\nequation (RTE) are absorption and thermal emission. This simplification is called\nSchwartzchild‚Äôs equation. Here, we will consider only cloud-free conditions. If a sensor\nviews vertically downwards into the atmosphere at a wavelength at which the atmosphere is\noptically thick, the brightness temperature/radiances that are received by sensor will be\ncharacteristic of the atmosphere at a depth below the sensor that is of the order of the\nabsorption length. Thus for bigger absorption coefficient, the absorption length is smaller and\nhence the temperature signal is received from higher altitude. So by making observations at a\nnumber of wavelengths near a broad absorption line, different altitudes in the atmosphere can\nbe investigated. Thermal infrared temperature profilers normally employ the broad and deep\nCO lines near 15 ÔÅ≠m wavelengths.\n2\nRadiative transfer equation in the non-scattering case may be written in simple form as:\n0 ÔÇ∂ÔÅ¥(pÔÇÆ0) ps ÔÇ∂ÔÅ¥(pÔÇÆp)\nI (pÔÄΩ0)ÔÄΩÔÅ•.B (T).ÔÅ¥(p ÔÇÆ0)ÔÄ´ÔÉ≤B [T(p)].

(ÔÇ∂ÔÅ¥/ÔÇ∂p) is called a weighting function. It weights the\nPlanck function in the atmospheric component of the emitted radiation. It specifies the layer\nfrom which the radiation emitted to space originates, and hence it determines the region of\nthe atmosphere that can be sensed from space at this wavelength. Fig.1 shows the\ntransmittance profiles and corresponding weighting functions at three wavelengths for which\nthe atmospheric absorption is different. Since the weighting function is the derivative of the\ntransmittance profile, it will peak higher in the atmosphere for the wavelengths at which the\nabsorption is stronger. In this way, if the atmosphere is observed at a number of carefully\nchosen wavelengths, whose weighting functions sample the atmosphere, then it is possible to\nretrieve the Planck‚Äôs function B (T) and thereby the temperature T itself.\nŒª\nTo explain this form of weighting functions, we consider the emission to space from air\nparcels of unit volume at different heights in the atmosphere. The radiation emitted to space\nis determined by three factors: temperature of the air parcel, number density of emitting gas,\nand transmittance of the atmosphere from the air parcel to space. For the lowest parcel, the\natmospheric density is high and so the amount of radiation emitted is high, but most of the\nradiation is absorbed in the atmosphere above it and very little reaches space. For the highest\nparcel, the transmittance to space is high, but comparatively little radiation is emitted because\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 249\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\n11--\nÔÅ¨ÔÅ¨\n33\nÔÇ≠ÔÇ≠\nÔÇ≠ÔÇ≠ ÔÅ¨ÔÅ¨\nÔÅ¥ÔÅ¥ 33 pp ÔÅ¨ÔÅ¨\npp 22\nÔÅ¨ÔÅ¨\n22\nÔÅ¨ÔÅ¨\n00-- 11 ÔÅ¨ÔÅ¨\n11\nÔÅ¨ÔÅ¨ ÔÅ¨ÔÅ¨ ÔÅ¨ÔÅ¨ 00 ÔÅ¥ÔÅ¥((ppÔÇÆÔÇÆ00)) 11 00 ÔÇ∂ÔÇ∂ÔÅ¥ÔÅ¥//ÔÇ∂ÔÇ∂pp 11\n11 22 33\nFFiigg..11:: SScchheemmaattiicc ddiiaaggrraamm ooff llaayyeerr ttoo ssppaaccee ttrraannssmmiittttaanncceess aatt\ntthhrreeee ssppeeccttrraall wwaavveelleennggtthhss\natmospheric density decreases exponentially with height. These two contrasting effects\ncombine in such a way that, at some intermediate height, the contribution of a parcel to the\nradiation reaching space is a maximum. The variation of the radiance to space as a function\nof height is shown by the curve on the right of the Fig.1.\nMost of the radiation to space originates in a layer around the peak of weighting function.\nFrom the knowledge of atmospheric composition and spectroscopic parameters we can\ncalculate where in the atmosphere this layer will be. Then the intensity of the radiation can be\ninterpreted in terms of the mean temperature of the layer. Using radiation at different\nfrequencies for which the absorption strength is different, we can build a group of weighting\nfunctions, which provide information on the mean temperatures of many such layers, thus\nleading to the retrieval of the atmospheric temperature profile from a set of multi-frequency\nmeasurements.\nIt is important to note that the weighting functions are broad, implying that the satellite\ninstrument can sense the mean properties of broad layers very well, but it is only able to\nsense the characteristics of single levels or narrow layers insofar as they are correlated with\nthe properties of the broad layers. Broad nature of the weighting functions restricts the\ncapability of satellite sounders to detect small-scale vertical structure of the atmospheric.\nInfrared sounder channels have spectral widths typically hundreds of times greater than the\natmospheric absorption lines. Therefore they average frequencies for which the absorption\nstrengths are very different. This has the effect of broadening the weighting functions\nconsiderably. By using instruments of much higher spectral resolution, such as\ninterferometers or grating spectrometers (e.g. AIRS, IASI), it is possible to achieve spectral\nresolutions closer to the widths of the atmospheric absorption lines. In this way instruments\nwith several thousand channels and much sharper weighting functions can be built.\nIn order for atmospheric temperature to be inferred from measurements of thermal emission,\nthe source of emission must be a relatively abundant gas of known and uniform distribution.\nOtherwise, the uncertainty in the abundance of the gas will make ambiguous the\ndetermination of temperature from the measurements. Carbon dioxide is one such gas in the\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 250\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\natmosphere having uniform known mixing ratio for altitudes below about 100 km, and has\nemission bands in the spectral regions that are convenient for measurement, e.g. 15ÔÅ≠m.\nThe forward problem:\nThe instrument makes measurements of radiance in a number of channels Œª. For each\ni\nchannel, we can write a radiative transfer equation (excluding reflection term):\nThis equation expresses the forward problem for the channel, i.e. given the state of the\natmosphere; the solution of this equation gives us the radiance incident at the satellite in this\nchannel. Using the radiances measured by the satellite radiometers, we can determine some\ninformation directly. For well-mixed gases such CO , we assume that the mixing ratio is\n2\nknown and independent of height. Wavelengths that are sensitive to these gases are used to\nretrieve atmospheric temperature. For wavelengths sensitive to variable trace gases, such as\n0 ÔÇ∂ÔÅ¥ (pÔÇÆ0)\nI (p ÔÄΩ0)ÔÄΩÔÅ•.B (T ).ÔÅ¥(p ÔÇÆ0)ÔÄ´ ÔÉ≤B [T(p)]. ÔÅ¨ .dp ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠(2)\nÔÅ¨ ÔÅ¨ ÔÅ¨ s ÔÅ¨ s ÔÅ¨ ÔÇ∂p\np\ns\nwater vapor and O , we assume that the temperature profile is known and use the radiances to\n3\nretrieve mixing ratios. Unfortunately, no wavelengths are completely free of absorption by\nthe variable trace gases; this contributes to errors in retrieving temperatures. Also, errors in\nour knowledge of temperature profiles lead to errors in trace-gas retrievals.\nThe above equations are strictly applicable only at a single wavelength, but satellite\ninstruments sense a band of wavelengths. So the equation must be integrated over\nwavelength using the spectral response function for each channel as a weight. This can be\nvery time-consuming. To overcome this problem, regression based fast transmittance models\nare formulated, in which the atmosphere is divided into predetermined layers, and the\ntransmittance of each layer, averaged over the response function of the radiometer is\ncalculated. Then the functions of temperature, humidity and zenith angle are fitted to the\nresults to generate regression coefficients for the fast model.\nThe inverse problem:\nInverse problem in the satellite meteorology is to obtain the state of the atmosphere (in terms\nof its vertical profiles of temperature and constituents) from the radiance measurements.\nSince we have a limited number of channels the inversion of equation is ill posed or under-\nconstrained. This means that there exist an infinite number of profiles that satisfy a given set\nof measurements. This is because the atmospheric state (unknown, e.g. temperature profile)\nis a continuous function of height, and measurements are from a finite number of channels.\nInverse problem is to find one that is reasonable and, if possible, to find the profile which is\nbest or most reasonable in some sense. In addition, the measurements always contain some\nerror or \"noise\". This further increases the ill-posed nature of the problem, and we must find\na method of solution that does not amplify the noise to an unacceptable degree. This implies\nthat we need information additional to the measurements in order to reach a solution. For\natmospheric remote sensing, additional information is available in the form of numerical\nmodel forecast and surface observation analysis.\nThere are several approaches for solution of this problem:\n1. Physical retrieval\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 251\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\n2. Statistical retrievals and\n3. Hybrid retrieval\nIn a physical retrieval, the forward problem is exploited in an iterative procedure:\n1. A first-guess temperature profile is chosen.\n2. The weighting functions are calculated.\n3. The forward problem is solved to yield estimates of the radiance in each channel.\n4. If computed radiances match the observed ones (within noise) then the current profile\nis accepted as the solution.\n5. If convergence is not achieved, the current profile is adjusted.\n6. Steps 3-5 are repeated until a solution is found.\nAn advantage of this approach is that physical processes are clearly evident at each stage.\nThe disadvantages are that the method is computationally intensive and it requires accurate\nknowledge about the transmittances. It also does not exploit the known statistical properties\nof the atmosphere.\nIn statistical retrieval, a training dataset, comprising radiosonde observations that are nearly\ncoincident in time and space with satellite soundings are compiled. A relationship between\nthe observed radiances and atmospheric profiles is established. In this approach physical\nprocesses are embedded in the statistics.\nAdvantages of this approach are (1) the actual retrievals are computationally simple (does not\nuse RTE) and (2) it requires no knowledge of the transmittances. It only uses the statistical\nproperties of the atmosphere. The disadvantage is that a large training data set is necessary.\nHybrid retrieval methods are in between the first two approaches. They are much like\nstatistical retrievals, but they do not require a large training dataset. They use weighting\nfunctions like physical retrievals, but they do not directly involve integration of the RTE.\nHybrid methods are easier to apply than the statistical or physical methods. They require\nknowledge of the transmittances, and they employ statistical knowledge of the atmosphere.\nTo summarize, there is no unique solution for the detailed vertical profile of temperature or\nan absorbing constituent because:\na. The outgoing radiances arise from relatively deep layers of the atmosphere,\nb. The radiances observed within various spectral channels come from overlapping layers\nof the atmosphere and are not vertically independent of each other, and\nc. Measurements of outgoing radiance possess errors.\nAs a consequence, there are a large number of analytical approaches to the profile retrieval\nproblem. The approaches differ both in the procedure for solving the set of spectrally\nindependent radiative transfer equations (e.g. matrix inversion, numerical iteration) and in the\ntype of ancillary data used to constrain the solution to insure a meteorologically meaningful\nresult (e.g. use of atmospheric covariance statistics, use of an a priori estimate of the profile\nstructure). Various methods of sounding retrievals have been reviewed by Fleming and\nSmith, 1971; Fritz et al., 1972; Rodgers, 1976; Twomey, 1977; and Houghton et al. 1984.\nFollowing sections describe the mathematical basis for two-step procedure, which will be\nused in the development of retrieval algorithm for atmospheric profiles from INSAT-3D\nSounder measurements.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 252\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\n16.4.1.2 Flow Chart:\nPresent sounder retrieval algorithm includes two steps:\n1.

This ‚Äúforward problem‚Äù\nis the heart of the physically based retrieval algorithms. The high rate of satellite\nobservations requires a forward model fast enough to keep pace with the observations.\nThough line-by-line models exist to accurately compute atmospheric transmittances, they are\nfar too slow to be practical. Thus fast atmospheric transmittance models are required for\noperational atmospheric sounding using physical methods. For INSAT-3D Sounder channels\nwe use Pressure Layer Optical Depth (PLOD) model, also known as pressure layer fast\nalgorithm for atmospheric transmittances (PFAAST), developed by Hanon et al (1996). This\nmodel has been widely used for profiles retrieval algorithm for GOES, NOAA-\nTOVS/ATOVS, Aqua-AIRS/MODIS, etc (Li et al. 2000; Li et al. 2001 etc, Ma et al. 1999).\nThe radiance recorded by the satellite sensor is the convolution of incident spectral radiance\nfunction with instrument‚Äôs spectral response function (SRF). Computing simulated radiances\nby calculating the monochromatic radiances and then convolving it with the instrument‚Äôs\nSRF takes too much time to be practical. In fast model PLOD a polychromatic approximation\nfor the transmittances is made which directly computes the approximate convolved radiances.\nThe monochromatic radiance leaving the top of the atmosphere, excluding scattering and\nreflection, is given by\nL\nRÔÄΩÔÅ•B(T(s))ÔÅ¥(L)ÔÄ´ÔÉ•B(T(i)).[ÔÅ¥(iÔÄ≠1)ÔÄ≠ÔÅ¥(i)] ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ (3)\ns z z z\niÔÄΩ1\nWhere, the atmospheric layers are numbered 1 to L from space to surface respectively.\nPLOD uses 101 atmospheric levels. B(T(i)) is the Planck function emission for layer ‚Äòi‚Äô at\ntemperature T(i) and ÔÅ¥ (i) is layer-to-space transmittance from layer ‚Äòi‚Äô to space. ÔÅ• is surface\nz s\nemissivity and T(s) is surface temperature. Applying the polychromatic approximation, we\nconvolve the layer-to-space transmittances and compute the radiances using above equation\ninstead of convolving the monochromatic radiances. PLOD model relates the convolved\nlayer-to-space transmittances to a simple function involving various profile dependent\npredictors. These predictors are functions of layer pressure, temperature, absorber amount,\nand viewing angle. Convolved transmittance is given by:\nN\nÔÄ≠ln(ÔÅ¥ )ÔÄΩÔÉ•cQ ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ (4)\neff i i\niÔÄΩ1\nÔÅ¥ is the effective layer transmittance, Q is the profile dependent predictor, and c are the\neff i i\nfast transmittance coefficients determined by linear regression of the above equation for a set\nof representative atmospheric profiles. PLOD model uses a regression on ‚Äìln(ÔÅ¥), i.e. the\noptical depth (k).\nA set of profiles is selected for calculation of the layer-to-space transmittances, which is used\nfor regression in fast coefficient computation. These profiles represent the entire range of\natmospheric variation, and should be weighted towards more typical cases. Computation of\nconvolved layer-to-space transmittances is time consuming, thereby restricting the practical\nlimit of number of profiles to be used in the regression. We use 49 regression profiles (6\nzenith angles upto 62.5ÔÇ∞), which cover most of profile behavior in the INSAT-3D viewing\nregion.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 254\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\nAll profiles should cover necessary vertical levels for temperature and absorbing gases.\nAmong absorbing gases only water vapor and ozone are allowed to vary in mixing ratio, and\nother gases are held ‚Äúfixed‚Äù. Fixed gases include all those whose spatial and temporal\nvariations have a negligible impact on the observed radiances. Monochromatic layer-to-space\ntransmittances computed for fixed and different absorbing gases at different zenith angles are\nconvolved with the instrument SRF. For each layer the effective layer optical depths (k ,\nfixed\nk , k ) are obtained for fixed and variable absorbing gases. These effective layer optical\nwater ozone\ndepths are used in a regression analysis to compute the fast transmittance coefficients (c).\ni\nChoosing the set of predictors for accurate results is mainly a matter of trial and error. PLOD\nmodel uses 8 predictors for fixed gases (k ), 13 for water vapor (k ), and 9 for ozone\nfixed water\n(k ). These predictors are functions of temperature, water vapor, ozone profiles and sensor\nozone\nviewing angle, and are summarized as follows:\nk : 1) a 2) a2 3) a.T 4) a.(T )2\nfixed r r\n5) T 6) (T )2 7) a.T 8) a.T / T\nr r z z r\nWhere, a is secant of the local path angle, T is the temperature ratio (T /T ), and T is\nr profile reference z\nthe pressure weighted temperature ratio above the layer:\nl\nT (l)ÔÄΩÔÉ•P(i).(P(i)ÔÄ≠P(iÔÄ≠1)).T (iÔÄ≠1) ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ (5)\nz r\niÔÄΩ2\nWhere P(i) is the average layer pressure for layer ‚Äòi‚Äô.\nk : For water vapor predictors are divided into two parts: one for total water optical depth\nwater\nabove the layer < 5, i.e.\n1) W.a 2) ÔÉñ(W.a) 3) W.a.dT 4) (W.a)2\n5) W.a.dT.|dT| 6) (W.a)3 7) W.a 8) ÔÉñ(W.a).dT\nz\n9) 4ÔÉñ(W.a) 10) (W .a)2 11) ÔÉñ(W.a)\nz z\nFor total water optical depth > 5,\n12) W.a 13) W.a/(W.a)2\nz\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 255\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\nW is water amount ratio (W /W ), dT is the temperature offset (T ‚Äì T ),\nprofile reference profile reference\nand W is pressure weighted water amount of W, i.e.\nz\nl\nÔÉ•P(i).(P(i)ÔÄ≠P(iÔÄ≠1)).W (i)\nprofile\nW (l)ÔÄΩ iÔÄΩ1 ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ (6)\nx l\nÔÉ•P(i).(P(i)ÔÄ≠P(iÔÄ≠1)).W (i)\nreference\niÔÄΩ1\nk Predictors for ozone are:\nozone:\n1) O.a 2) ÔÉñ(O.a) 3) O.a.dT 4) (O.a)2\n5) ÔÉñ(O.a).dT 6) O .a 7) O.a.ÔÉñ(O .a) 8) O.a.W.a\nz z\n9) TO .O.a\nz\nwhere O is ozone amount ratio (O /O ), O is the pressure weighted ozone\nprofile reference z\namount ratio above\nl\nO (l)ÔÄΩÔÉ•P(i).(P(i)ÔÄ≠P(iÔÄ≠1)).O(iÔÄ≠1) ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ (7)\nz\niÔÄΩ2\nand TO is pressure and ozone weighted temperature ratio above\nz\nl\nTO (l)ÔÄΩÔÉ•P(i).(P(i)ÔÄ≠P(iÔÄ≠1)).T (iÔÄ≠1).O(iÔÄ≠1) ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠ÔÄ≠(8)\nz r\niÔÄΩ2\nFinally the layer transmittance is given by,\nÔÅ¥ = ÔÅ¥ * ÔÅ¥ * ÔÅ¥ ------- (9)\neff fixed water ozone\n16.4.2.2 Cloud detection:\nSince atmospheric profiles can be retrieved only over cloud free observations, it is\nessential to detect the cloudy pixels. For each sounder pixel, a cloud detection algorithm\nis to be applied to get the clear/cloudy index. Various cloud-detection schemes are\ndeveloped and implemented for infrared sounders (Smith et al. 1979; McMillen and Dean\n1982; Hayden 1988). Each pixel undergoes several tests for clear/cloudy identifications:\nÔÇ∑ During daytime if visible channel#19 count is greater then a threshold, then the\npixel is considered cloudy.\nÔÇ∑ If longwave window channel (channel#8, 11.0ÔÅ≠m) brightness temperature is too\ncold (< 250) then the pixel is classified cloudy.\nÔÇ∑ If the longwave window brightness temperature is 4 K cooler than that of the\nwarmest pixel from 8 adjacent pixels, then this pixel is classified as cloudy.\nÔÇ∑ Different window channels (thermal IR channels 8 and mid IR window channels\n17, 18) have different transparency. After atmospheric correction to each\nchannel, few checks are applied to classify the pixel as clear/cloudy. During\ndaytime very high difference in channel 8 and 18 brightness temperature\nindicates presence of clouds. Thresholds for differences in different channels\nbrightness temperature are to be determined by RT simulations.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 256\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\nÔÇ∑ Sounder channel brightness temperatures are simulated for each pixel using\nnumerical model forecast profiles. If difference between simulated and observed\nsounder brightness temperature for cloud sensitive channels (3, 4, 5, 8, 13, 14,\n15) is large (threshold decided by the forward model error and forecast error),\nthen this pixel is classified as cloudy.\nIf there are at least 9 clear pixels in the field-of-regard (FOR) comprised of 5 x 5\npixels (or 4 clear pixels in the FOR comprised of 3 x 3 pixels), then the average of all\npixels brightness temperatures for this FOR is used for clear-sky retrieval. This\naveraging reduces the random noise of measurements over individual pixels.\n16.4.2.3 Regression Retrieval:\nA computationally efficient method for determining temperature and moisture profiles\nfrom satellite sounding measurements uses previously determined statistical relationships\nbetween observed (or modeled) radiances and the corresponding atmospheric profiles.\nThis method is often used to generate a first-guess for a physical retrieval algorithm, as is\ndone in the International TOVS Processing Package (ITPP, Smith et al., 1993) and\nInternational ATOVS Processing Package (IAPP, Li et al, 2000). The statistical\nregression algorithm for atmospheric temperature is described in detail in Smith et. al.\n(1970).\nRegression coefficients are required to correlate observed radiances with vertical profile\nvectors. This derivation of regression coefficients in turn requires generation of training\ndataset from radiosonde profiles of temperature, humidity, ozone profiles, surface\npressure representing the entire variations. Training dataset generated by CIMSS/SSEC,\nUniversity of Wisconsin is used, which contains more then 12000 profiles. To include\nmore local data into the training dataset and to create a testing dataset, radiosonde data\nover INSAT-3D viewing region is collocated and quality checked. These are total\n~40,000 profiles spanning over 2 years, twice daily observations. Surface emissivities at\neach sounder channel wavelength for all profiles are assigned from the global emissivity\ndataset generated by Seeman et al. (2006) at CIMSS. Sounder radiances/brightness\ntemperature will be simulated using fast radiative transfer model (PLOD) and suitable\ninstrument noise will be added to the simulated radiances. Regression coefficients\nbetween atmospheric profile vector, X (T-, q-, O -profiles, T ), with Sounder\n3 s\nobservations, Y (brightness temperatures) are computed at different zenith angles from\nsimulated training dataset using:\nRC = dX.dYT.(dY.dYT)-1 --------- (10)\nWhere, dX = X - X , and dY = Y - Y\nmean mean\nThese regression coefficients can be used to retrieve the atmospheric profiles, X, using\nthe following relation:\nX = X + RC.(dY )T ---------- (11)\nmean obs\nEmissivity and surface pressure are also used as predictors along with the brightness\ntemperature observations to improve the retrieval accuracy. Quadratic term of all\nbrightness temperatures is used as predictors to account for the moisture non-linearity in\nthe sounder observations. Separate regression coefficients are generated for land and\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 257\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\nsea for day and night conditions. Regression coefficients are generated for different\nlocal zenith angles from nadir to 62.5ÔÇ∞.\nIf any one or more channels in sounder become unusable, then regression\ncoefficients will be recomputed from remaining well-behaved channels and suitable\nmodification will be done in regression retrieval routine. In absence of regression\nretrieval the first guess will be taken from the model forecast.\nAnother way to generate profile vectors through regression is by using the matchup file\nthat contains the time and space collocated satellite radiance measurements and\nradiosonde profiles used for generation of the regression coefficients. This may be\nattempted after the launch of satellite and when enough collocated data points have been\ngenerated to represent the profiles variability. The advantage of the regression retrieval\nusing the theoretically computed regression coefficients over real observations is that it\navoids errors due to space and time differences between satellite observation and\nradiosonde profile observation. Observed matchup data would be very useful for\nremoving the bias error caused by the forward model calculations.\n16.4.2.4 Non-Linear Physical Retrieval\nThough statistical regression algorithm has the advantage of being computationally\nefficient, numerically stable, and simple, it does not account for the physical properties of\nthe radiative transfer equation (RTE). Therefore, after computing atmospheric profiles\nfrom the regression technique and creating a hybrid first-guess combining with model\nforecast, a non-linear iterative physical algorithm (Li et al., 2000, Ma et at. 1999, Seeman\nat al. 2003) is applied to the RTE to improve the solution.\nFor non-scattering atmosphere in local thermodynamic equilibrium, the radiative transfer\nequation may be written as: Following derivation by Li et al (1994) the RTE may be\n0 ÔÇ∂ÔÅ¥ (p ÔÇÆ0)\nI (p ÔÄΩ0) ÔÄΩÔÅ• .B (T ).ÔÅ¥ (p ÔÇÆ0)ÔÄ´ ÔÉ≤B [T(p)].

Analytical forms of these weighting\nfunctions are derived in Li et al (2000) have the following form:\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 258\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\n-----(15)\nPhysical retrieval involves minimization of the following cost function (Rodgers 1976):\nJ(X)=[Ym ‚Äì Y(X)]T.E-1.[Ym ‚Äì Y(X)] + (X - X )T.H-1.(X ‚Äì X ) --------- (16)\n0 0\nMinimization uses the following non-linear Newtonian iteration:\nX = X + J‚Äù(X )-1.J‚Äô(X ) -------- (17)\nn+1 n n n\nThis gives the following non-linear iterative form (Eyre 1989):\nT -1 -1 T -1 m\nX = X + (K E K + H) . {K E [dY + K (X ‚Äì X )]} -------- (18)\nn+1 0 n n n n n n 0\nWhere, X is the atmospheric profile to be retrieved, X is the initial state of the\n0\natmospheric profile or the first guess, Ym is the observed brightness temperature vector, E\nis the observation error covariance matrix that includes instrument noise and forward\nmodel error, H is the a priori matrix that constrains the solution, which can be first guess\nerror covariance matrix or another type of matrix. Usually H=ÔÅßI, where ÔÅß is the smoothing\nfactor.

If ÔÅß is\ntoo large then the solution is over-constrained and large biases could be created in the\nretrieval, while if ÔÅß is too small, the solution is less constrained, and possibly unstable.\nThe value ÔÅß is dependent upon the observations, the observation error, and the first guess\nof the atmospheric profile, and often chosen empirically (Smith et al. 1985; Hayden\n1988). Often it is chosen empirically (Susskind 1984; Smith et al. 1985; Hayden 1988).\nLi at al. (2000) uses discrepancy principle (Li and Huang 1999) to determine ÔÅß and is\nchanged in each iteration according to\nÔÅß = q .ÔÅß ---------- (20)\nn+1 n n\nq is a factor for ÔÅß increasing or decreasing. q is obtained in each iteration by the following\ncondition:\nq = 1; if ||F(X ) ‚Äì Ym||2 < ÔÅ≥2 then q = 1.5 --------- (21a)\n0 n n\nif ||F(X ) ‚Äì Ym||2 > ÔÅ≥2 then q = 0.8 --------- (21b)\nn n\nWhere, ÔÅ≥2 = ÔÉ• e 2, e is the observation error of channel k which includes instrument\nk k\nerror and forward model error. The q factor is found from empirical experience to ensure\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 259\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\nthat the solution is stable from one iteration to the next. This factor would be required to\ntune-up carefully for the INSAT-3D Sounder channels.\nSince atmospheric variables correlate between different levels, only a limited number of\nvariables are needed to explain the vertical structure of atmosphere (Smith and woolf\n1976). Thus it is computationally efficient to solve the iterative equation. This reduces\nthe number of unknown expansion coefficients to the same order as the number of\nmeasured radiances:\nÔÅ§X = ÔÉ•fv = V.f, i = 1, M --------- (22)\ni i\nWhere, v is the ith eigenvector, f is the ith expansion coefficient, and M denotes the\ni i\nnumber of terms. V and f represent the eigenvector matrix and coefficient vector,\nrespectively. These eigenvectors are derived from a statistical covariance matrix of a\nlarge profile set of temperature, moisture and ozone.\n~\nÔÅ§Y = K.ÔÅ§X = K.V.f =K.f --------- (23)\nCorresponding iterative equation becomes,\n~ ~ ~ ~\nT -1 -1 T -1 m\nf = (K E K + ÔÅß I) . {K E [dY + K f )]} ---------- (24)\nn+1 n n n n n n n\nThus the retrieval problem is reduced to finding a set of coefficients that may be used\nwith eigenvectors to update the meteorological variables. Statistical analysis of the GOES\nradiance information content (similar to INSAT-3D Sounder) reveals that five\ntemperature and three water vapor eigenvectors explain all the variance in the sounder\nchannels occurring above the instrument noise level (Ma et al 1999). Therefore, the\nphysical retrieval problem has been reduced to one of solving for ten unknowns (five\ntemperature eigenvector coefficients, three water vapor eigenvector coefficients, one\nozone eigenvector coefficient, plus surface skin temperature perturbation) from 18\nINSAT Sounder observations plus two surface observations: surface air temperature and\nhumidity. In absence of the surface observations only sounder observations will be used\nfor observation vector.\nAt each iterative step in the physical retrieval procedure, convergence tests are carried out\nfor the quality control of the profile retrievals. Following two convergence tests are\ncarried out at each iteration and if one of the test fails, then the retrieval is rejected.\n(i) The expansion coefficient convergence test defines the coefficient distance, d\nn+1\ndefined by:\n~ ~\nd = (f - f )T.( K TE-1K + ÔÅßI)-1 (f - f ) ------- (25)\nn+1 n+1 n n n n n+1 n\nThis should approach zero as the solution converges. At each iteration, the norm of\nthe coefficient distance d is calculated and compared with previous iteration.

Radiosonde profiles collocated with satellite observations will be generated over\nclear-sky conditions for different regions representing entire variability in atmospheric\nprofiles. These collocated observations will also be used to correct the biases in the\nforward model, and then incorporated in the regression and physical retrieval routines for\naccurate retrievals and convergence.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 262\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\n16.6.1 Radiance bias removal\nAtmospheric profile retrieval is based on modifying the surface temperature and\natmospheric temperature/moisture profiles in a manner such that brightness temperatures\ncalculated agree with those observed from the satellite, within some uncertainty estimate,\nfor the sounding spectral bands.\nFor INSAT-3D Sounder we begin with a first guess profile, which is a weighted linear\ncombination of profiles obtained from regression retrieval and NWP model forecast,\ninterpolated in time and space to the location of the satellite measurement. The difference\nbetween the observation and the \"forward calculation\" from the first-guess profile\nrepresents the information available in the observation.\nHowever, in practice there are generally bias errors associated with the comparison of\nobservation and the forward calculation. These may be due to calibration error,\nuncertainties in the filter functions, or imprecision in the transmittance model used in the\nforward calculation. Consequently, prior to calculating retrieval, bias error for each band\nis subtracted from the observation. Estimates of the bias error are obtained by examining\nensembles of collocated observations and forward calculations where the atmospheric\nstate is well known (i.e. in the vicinity of radiosondes).\n16.6.2 Data Required\nParameter Source\nTemperature and humidity profile Radiosonde observations, IMD\nOzone profile Ozonesonde observations, IMD\nSounder Channel Observations collocated NOAA, EUMETSAT\nwith radiosonde observations\nSpace and time collocated (within 100 km in space and 3 hours in time) profiles of\ntemperature, humidity and ozone may also be obtained from the various other satellite\nmissions, such as Aqua-AIRS/MODIS/AMSU, Metop-IASI, NOAA-ATOVS/AMSU, etc\nfor the purpose of inter-comparison.\n16.6.3 Methods of Validation\nFrom the observed collocated profiles of temperature, humidity and ozone for clear sky\nconditions, brightness temperatures corresponding to Sounder channels will be computed\nwith the help of fast radiative transfer model used in the physical retrieval routine. The\ncomputed brightness temperatures are analysed with Sounder-observed brightness\ntemperatures to estimate the bias (slope and intercept of the linear regression equation)\nfor each of the sounder channels. These bias-corrections will be implemented in the\nregression and physical retrieval routines to remove the bias between sounder\nobservations and fast RT model computations.\nFor clear sky conditions the observed profiles of temperature, humidity and ozone will be\ninterpolated at the pressure levels of retrieval output (standard 40 pressure levels) and\nroot mean square errors (rmse) from space and time collocated retrieved profiles will be\ncomputed at each vertical pressure levels. Separate statistics may be generated for\nretrievals over land and ocean.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 263\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\n16.7 Technical Issues\nFinal accuracy of the retrieved profiles will largely depend upon the accuracy of the fast\nradiative transfer model used in the retrieval procedure. Therefore, fast radiative transfer\nmodel needs to be properly validated and the forward model errors should be within\ninstrument noise level.\nAncillary data improves the quality of sounding retrieval near surface. However,\nsuch observations are very few over Indian region (INSAT-3D viewing region),\ntherefore, the network of the automatic weather stations (AWS) needs to be\nstrengthened.\nIMD has a network of radiosonde observations over India; however, for INSAT-3D\nvalidation and bias removal procedure highly accurate profiles are required. Therefore,\nfor a limited period of time (6 months after launch), high quality radiosonde (Vaisala)\nobservations should be available over land as well as ocean (special ship cruises) under\nclear sky conditions.\nCurrently, ozone information is available only from single channel in Sounder,\ntherefore, retrieval of ozone profile may not be very accurate and column integrated\nozone will be more reliable product.\n16.8 Future Scope\nWith the advancement in the spectroscopic measurements of atmospheric gases it is\npossible to make improvement in the radiative transfer model. Improved fast radiative\ntransfer models may be coupled with the physical retrieval routine in future, as and when\navailable. Improvements will also be attempted by incorporating improved training\ndataset in regression retrieval.\nAnother area for future development is improvement of cloud detection algorithm. This\nmay include synergy of high-resolution Imager data with Sounder observations to detect\nsub-pixel level cloud contamination.\nInitially, the retrieval will be attempted only over cloud-free FOVs. In future, an\nalgorithm will be developed and implemented with retrieval routine to compute the\ncloud-cleared radiances over partially cloudy pixels.\nRetrieval of profiles in overcast conditions (valid above cloud top) will also be attempted\nin near future.\nThis algorithm will also be useful for future hyper-spectral missions with suitable\nmodifications.\n16.9 References\n1.

Central wavelengths of these channels along with the typical noise\nsensitivity are summarized in the table-1.\nA flat elliptical scan mirror mounted at 45ÔÇ∞ to the optical axis intercepts the radiation and\nreflects it on to 310mm reflective telescope. At the telescope, dichroic beam splitters\nseparate the visible spectrum and three IR coarse bands. The three IR bands then pass\nthrough the concentric ring of a cold filter wheel maintained at a low temperature (-\n230ÔÇ∞C) to limit the background radiation. Channel filters on the filter wheel provide\nsequential sampling of defined narrow band spectral channels. There are three concentric\nrings on the filter wheel, each catering to a coarse band. Each of the rings is further\ndivided in to a number of sectors each housing filter for a channel. Detector arrays for\neach coarse band consist of four elements arranged in north-south direction. Thus the\ncombined IFOV of the arrays is 280 (E-W) x 1120 (N-S) ÔÅ≠R2. The IR detectors are\nmounted inside the radiant cooler and cooled to cryogenic temperature of less than 100K\nfor improving noise performance detectors. The temperature of the detectors is\nmaintained at fixed value using temperature sensors and heaters in a servo-loop.\nThe scan mirror operates in step and dwell mode to facilitate sequential sounding. The\neast-west step size of scan mirror will be 280¬µR (10km). At each step, the mirror dwells\nfor 0.1 second to allow completion of full spectral coverage through filter wheel drive.\nAfter completing acquiring data in all bands, the mirror steps in north south direction by\n1120 ¬µR (40 km). The rotation of the filter wheel is synchronized to the mirror stepping\nso that the mirror remains stationary during the sounding. To optimize efficiency, both\nforward and reverse scans are used for data collection. In addition to full earth disc\ncoverage, flexible programme modes are provided to cater to different coverage\nrequirements based on dynamics of atmospheric environment. The scan mirror traverses\nto the space-look position to get cold reference for the IR detectors. The interval between\ntwo space-looks is of the order of one minute. The space-look periodicity is decided\nbased on the estimate of the interval required for maintaining stable background and\ntemperature of the IR detector so that the space-look data remains valid during this\nperiod. It is proposed to have a provision within the scan mechanism to accept motion\ncompensation signal from AOCS to compensate for the various spacecraft rates, orbit\nperturbations and effect of the imager mirror slew on the spacecraft. Four detectors per\ncoarse band in north-south direction will generate four soundings per channel for every\nstep and dwell interval of 0.1 second through a complete rotation of the filter-wheel. Thus\nthere are a total of sixteen detectors in the instrument, twelve for IR sounding channels\nand four for visible channel.\nThe normal mode of Sounder operation covers 6000km x 6000km field of view and takes\napproximately 160 minutes. In addition, the instrument is designed with flexible modes\nof operation for fast and repetitive coverage.\nThe cold space view is used for signal referencing and as a calibration point for all bands.\nIn-orbit multipoint calibration of the IR channel is carried out through viewing of full\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 268\nTemperature, Moisture Profile and Total Ozone from Sounder\naperture high emissivity internal cavity, whose physical temperature is accurately\nmonitored at multiple locations and transmitted in Sounder data stream.\nThe detector outputs are individually amplified, integrated in synchronism with the filter\nwheel movement and digitized to twelve bits by A/D converter. The digitized data along\nwith house keeping and calibration information is formatted, randomized and sent to\ntransmitter as a serial data stream. The data rate is approximately 40 Kbps.\nThe temperature control of the IR detector mounted on cooled patch as well as that of\nfilter wheel will be achieved through proportional controller.\nTable 2: INSAT-3D Sounder Channels Characteristics\nDetector\nCh.

However, the upcoming INSAT-3D data with\nimproved spatial and temporal resolution can be used for near real time detection and\nmapping of fog.\nThe detection of fog/low stratus with satellite data has been taken up since many years\n(Bendix 2002. The general methodology of fog detection involves identification of some\nthreshold radiances or brightness temperature at different wavelengths. Fog is formed\nwhen vapor in the lower atmosphere condensed in cold conditions. The fog droplets are\nmuch smaller than the cloud droplet. The presence of these droplets affects the\natmospheric visibility. The radiation difference between the cloud and fog is due to the\nspectral response differences of every channel. This provides the basis of fog detection.\n17.2.2 Objective\nTo identify the presence of fog from INSAT-3D data\n17.3 Inputs\nThe following table gives a list of inputs required for algorithm input and calibration\n17.3.1 Static Data\nData Resolution Unit Source\nSurface elevation Pixel level meters USGS or other gridded data\nabove mean sea level available on internet.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 273\nLand surface temperature\n17.3.2 Image and Calibration Inputs\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nRadiometric and Derived from\ngeometric corrected raw data by\npixel 10 bit --\ngray count values DP (data\nof VIS channel (6.5) processing)\nRadiometric and Derived from\ngeometric corrected raw data by\npixel 10 bit --\ngray count values DP (data\nof MIR channel (3.9) processing)\nRadiometric and\ngeometric corrected Derived from\ngray count values pixel 10 bit - raw data by\nof TIR-I channel DP\n(10.5)\nGray value to\nbrightness\nDerived by\ntemperature (MIR, - - 0.3 K\nDP\nTIR-1) conversion\ntable\nGray value to albedo\nDerived by\n(VIS) conversion - - 0.3 K\nDP\ntable\nDerived by\nGeolocation file Pixel - 1 pixel\nDP\n17.3.3 Other Auxillary data\nParameter Resolution Quantization Accuracy Source\nSolar Zenith Angle pixel - -- Derived by DP\nSatellite Zenith\npixel - -- Derived by DP\nAngle\nAzimuth Angle pixel - - Derived by DP\nDerived under\nSnow Map pixel - -\nIMDPS\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 274\nLand surface temperature\n17.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n17.4.1 Overview\n17.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\nNight Time Fog Detection\nThe difference of brightness temperature corresponding to two spectral channels (3.9 and\n10.8ÔÅ≠m) is used for the identification of fog. The theoretical basis for the detection of fog\nusing 3.9ÔÅ≠m and ~11 ÔÅ≠m channels rely on the particular emissivity properties for fog\ndroplets (Bendix and Bechmann, 1991) in these two channels. The small droplets found\nin fog are less emissive at 3.9 ÔÅ≠m than at ~11ÔÅ≠m whereas emissivities are roughly same\nfor larger droplets (Hunt, 1973) in both the channels. The difference between brightness\ntemperatures measured at different wavelength is tested against a threshold value and\nattributed to the categories of clear/ fog/other clouds etc.. The difference in brightness\ntemperature values below 0.5 K is assumed to be cloud free and above 2.5 K is\nrepresented as opaque clouds (Ellord, 1995). However, a threshold of 5.5 K to 7.0 K has\nbeen observed for fog developed over the Indo Gangetic plains of India (Chaurasia et al,\n2011) ranging from thin to thick fog case using MODIS data. This threshold will change\nwith spatial and spectral resolution of the satellite data used for the detection of fog.\nApart from this it also varies from time to time as well as from place to place and types of\nfog.\nFlowchart for nighttime fog detection\nÔÅÑTB >ÔÅÑTB min Fog\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 275\nLand surface temperature\nDay Time Fog Detection\nThe basis of the algorithm is a gross cloud check. This test is based on the assumption\nthat the brightness temperature of high clouds are very low (<270 0K) and the brightness\ntemperature of fog lies between that of land (very high brightness temperature) and high\nclouds during day time. The high cloud regions are eliminated by using a threshold of\nOnce the region is classified as foggy, the day time detection algorithm is used. The day\ntime algorithm of fog detection is based on the temporal differencing technique (Paul\nd‚ÄôEntremont and Gustafson, 2003) which is used operationally to monitor cloud using\ngeostationary data. In this method apart from using thermal channel like TIR1 channel of\nINSAT-3D for cloud detection, the visible channel (0.55-\ndroplet size of fog being close to the wavelength of visible and infrared radiation, fog has\nprominent scattering effect. Thus the visible channel plays an important role in detecting\nday time fog.\n17.4.1.2 Flow chart for day time fog detection\nImager Data\nCoversionfrom DN to\nReflectance/ BT\nGeneration of\ncloud free image Gross Cloud Check Not a Cloud\nusing past 10/15\nCloud\nday data\nElimination of snow pixel\nCloudy/Foggy Data\nTemporal Differencing Technique\nFog/\nLow\nSurface Elevation test Homogeneity Test\nStratus\n17.4.2 Operational Implementation\nNight Time Fog Detection\n17.4.2.1 Selection of night time data only by using information of solar zenith angle and\nvisible count\n17.4.2.2 Conversion of grey count to brightness temperature\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 276\nLand surface temperature\n17.4.2.3 Gross cloud testing using 10.8 Œºm brightness temperature\n17.4.2.4 High cloud elimination by using 10.8 Œºm brightness temperature threshold\n17.4.2.5 Removal of remaining snow pixel by using 10.8 Œºm brightness temperature\nthresholding\n17.4.2.6 Difference between 10.8 and 3.9 ÔÅ≠m channel brightness temperatures.\n17.4.2.7 Fog detection\n(The minimum value of brightness temperature difference ŒîTB above which\nmin\nthe pixel is flagged to be fog is determined dynamically.

Singh\n18.2 Introduction\n18.2.1 Importance of Land surface temperature and its retrieval\nLand surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the land surface\nprocesses and climate studies on global and regional scales. It is needed as an input to a\nvariety of climatic, ecological, hydrological and biogeochemical studies. Retrieval of\nLST from the Earth observation satellite is quite challenging since the land surface is\nlaterally inhomogeneous and is composed of various materials with different geometries.\nSurface temperatures are derived from satellite based measurements in the thermal\ninfrared (TIR) window channels using either empirical method or physical algorithm.\nA number of Earth observation satellites such as EOS-MODIS, ASTER, AATSR,\nNOAA-AVHRR, Landsat ETM+, GOES-8, GOES-R, MSG-SEVIRI etc have TIR\nchannels to derive LST. Various algorithms and coefficients have been developed for\nLST retrieval for these systems and reported in the literature over a period of time\n(Ulivieri et al., 1994, Wan and Dozier, 1996, Sobrino et al., 2000, Sun and Pinker, 2003,\nSobrino et al., 2004, Kerr et al., 2004, S√≤ria and Sobrino, 2007, Sun and Pinker, 2007,\nYu et al., 2009).\nIndian Earth observation satellites such as INSAT-2E, Kalpana-1, INSAT-3A and\nINSAT-3D have also TIR channels for surface temperature retrieval purpose. However,\nlittle attention has been paid to develop the method for estimating LST from Indian\nsensors. A Single Channel (SC) algorithm for retrieving LST from the thermal channel\n(10.5-12.5 ¬µm) of Kalpana-1 (K1) VHRR sensor was developed over India using a\nradiative transfer model (Pandya et al., 2010, Pandya et al., 2013). In order to exploit the\npresence of two TIR channels in the INSAT-3D Imager sensor for better estimation of\nLST, a study has been taken up to develop a method to retrieve LST through a split-\nwindow (SW) algorithm.\nObjective of the present work is to develop an algorithm to retrieve LST using two TIR\nchannels of the Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D satellite using a radiative transfer (RT)\nmodel over India. Study also presents the comparison of INSAT-3D LST to the\ncontemporaneous LST products available from the MODIS and K1 satellites.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 283\nLand surface temperature\n18.2.2 Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D\nINSAT-3D is the new generation Indian Earth observation satellite launched by ISRO on\nJuly 26, 2013. It provides enhanced observations of land, ocean and atmosphere through\ntwo payloads namely Imager and Sounder from the geostationary orbit. The Imager\npayload is designed to sense solar-reflected and radiant energy from the Earth through six\nchannels covering visible (VIS: 0.55-0.75 ÔÅ≠m), shortwave infrared (SWIR: 1.55-1.70\nÔÅ≠m), middle infrared (MIR: 3.8-4.0 ÔÅ≠m), water vapor infrared (WVIR: 6.5-7.1 ÔÅ≠m) and\nthermal infrared (TIR1: 10.3-11.3 ÔÅ≠m and TIR2: 11.5-12.5 ÔÅ≠m) spectral regions of\nelectromagnetic spectrum having varying spatial resolution ranging from 1 km to 8 km\n(CDR, 2009). Nominal specifications of spectral and spatial details of the Imager payload\nare provided in table 1.\nTable 1: Spectral and spatial specifications of Imager payload onboard INSAT-3D\nsatellite (Source: CDR, 2009)\nChannel Range of the Spectral channel Spatial resolution (at nadir)\nVIS 0.55-0.75 ÔÅ≠m 1 km\nSWIR 1.55-1.70 ÔÅ≠m 1 km\nMIR 3.80-4.00 ÔÅ≠m 4 km\nWVIR 6.50-7.10 ÔÅ≠m 8 km\nTIR1 10.3-11.3 ÔÅ≠m 4 km\nTIR2 11.5-12.5 ÔÅ≠m 4 km\nThe TIR1 and TIR2 are two thermal channels centered at 10.8 ÔÅ≠m and 12.0 ÔÅ≠m\nrespectively, which can be used to derive LST through a split-window algorithm.

View zenith angle for the INSAT-3D satellite located at 84 degree E\nTo derive LST from various satellite-based sensors several types of split-window (SW)\nalgorithms have been developed during past three decades; however, SW algorithm for\nIndian sensor has not been attempted. This document presents a theoretical base study\nthat was carried out to develop a SW algorithm for LST retrieval using TIR observations\nfrom the INSAT-3D Imager.\n18.3 THEORETICAL BACKGROUND\nThermal infrared signal received by satellite sensors is combination of three parameters,\nnamely; (1) surface temperature and surface emissivity, (2) atmospheric emission,\nabsorption and scattering acting upon thermal radiation from the surface, and (3) the solar\nradiation during daytime. In the absence of atmosphere, estimation of LST of the Earth‚Äôs\nsurface would be much simpler task. On the other hand, the presence of Earth‚Äôs\natmosphere between the satellite and the surface changes the surface emitted radiances\nmeasured by the satellite sensor in several ways, making LST retrieval from satellite\nbased platform a complex task (Dash et al. 2002).\nThe transmission of the surface emitted radiance through the atmosphere to the satellite,\nand its interaction with the active elements of the atmosphere is expressed as Radiative\nTransfer Equation (RTE) (Dash et al. 2002).\nWhere,\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 285\nLand surface temperature\n= the radiance measured by the satellite based sensor (W/m2.sr.¬µm),\n= the at-sensor brightness temperature (K)\n= the surface emissivity\n= Planck radiance at surface temperature\n= atmospheric transmittance\n= upwelling path radiance\n= downwelling sky radiance at Earth‚Äôs surface\nThe first term stands for the surface-emitted radiance after being attenuated by the\natmosphere, second term corresponds to the upwelling sky radiance emitted by the\natmosphere towards the sensor, and last term represents the downwelling radiation\nreaching the sensor after being reflected from the Earth‚Äôs surface. Here all the quantities\nrefer to a spectral integration over the bandwidth of channel i and depend on the view\nzenith angle.\nThe Planck radiance B(T ) is expressed as,\ni s\nc\nB (T ) ÔÄΩ 1 (2)\ni s ÔÉ¶ c ÔÉ∂\n2\nÔÅ¨5.

(1) we get,\nIn this problem, the surface temperature is basically coupled with two factors: the surface\nemissivity and the atmospheric absorptions. Developing an LST algorithm means to find\na solution of decoupling the emissivity and the atmospheric absorption effects from the\nsatellite measured radiance. The surface temperature T can be obtained from Eq. 1 and 2\ns\nby correcting the atmospheric and emissivity effects and then by calculating T by\ns\ninversion of the Planck‚Äôs law. However, atmospheric correction of TIR radiances is the\nmost difficult part (Liang, 2004). The use of SW algorithm avoids the atmospheric\ncorrection issue. This method uses two thermal bands typically located in the atmospheric\nwindow between 10.5-12.5 ÔÅ≠m. The basis of the technique is that the radiance attenuation\nfor atmospheric absorption is proportional to the radiance difference of simultaneous\nmeasurements at two different wavelengths, each subject to different amounts of\natmospheric absorption. Actually SW algorithm provides atmospheric correction of a\nbrightness temperature measurement in one spectral band (typically cantered around 11\nÔÅ≠m) given a brightness temperature measurement in a second ‚Äúspectrally-close‚Äù band\n(typically cantered around 12 ÔÅ≠m) (figure 3). They exploit the differential absorption\ntendency of two neighbouring spectral bands due to various gases. To estimate LST from\nsatellite observations, most SW algorithms are derived from a first-order Taylor-series\nlinearization of the RT equation in long-wave infrared spectral bands (Yu, 2009).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 286\nLand surface temperature\nMIR WVIR TIR1 TIR2\n1.0\ne 0.8 0.1 g/cm2\nc\nn\na\nt 0.6\nt\ni\nm\nn s 0.4 3.0 g/cm2\na\nr\nT\n0.2\n6.0 g/cm2\n0.0\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14\nWavelength in micrometer\nFigure 3: Atmospheric transmission computed for different atmospheric water vapour\ncontent using the MODTRAN model for nadir observations with surface temperature of\n305K.

In most cases,\nthe SW LST algorithms simultaneously convert brightness temperature to skin\ntemperature, given the estimates of the surface spectral emissivity. A review of the SW\ntechnique and published SW algorithms can be found in Li et al., (2013).

The split-window algorithm requires a forward simulation study for generating split-\nwindow coefficients through the RT model using various inputs (details discussed in the\nnext sections). With the use of these split-window coefficients and emissivity information,\nthe radiance observed at the top-of-atmosphere by the INSAT-3D Imager sensor is\nconverted into the LST. The LST images generated from the INSAT-3D Imager sensor\ncan then be compared with (a) K1-LST products available on MOSDAC archival system\nand (b) MODIS LST products available through the NASA‚Äôs archival system.

In an earlier\nanalysis reported in a paper (Pandya et al., 2011b), various SW algorithms were\nevaluated for LST retrieval from the INSAT-3D Imager sensor. Ten different published\nSW algorithms (or their slight variants) from the literature were evaluated and compared\nin the study and the following suitable form of algorithm (Eq. 3) was selected for the\nImager sensor.\nT ÔÄΩa ÔÄ´a .T ÔÄ´a .

McClain et al. (1985)\nfirst pointed out that, at high viewing angles, atmospheric absorption is amplified.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 288\nLand surface temperature\nGeometric analysis shows that the atmospheric path length at the sensor‚Äôs edge-of-scan\n(for view zenith angle ~65 degree) is at least 2.5 times higher than at nadir. Pandya et al.\n(2011a) have also shown that at-sensor radiance value observed by the Imager sensor\nreduces with increasing view zenith angle by an amount of 7 to 8 percent for 300 K target.\nThis has a significant effect on the satellite measured brightness temperature. For a target\non the ground having 300 K temperature and 0.98 emissivity with average atmospheric\nwater vapor of 1.5 g/cm2, the at-sensor brightness temperature varies between 297.2 K to\n295.5 K for atmospheric path length changing from 1 to 2 corresponding to view zenith\nangle varying between 0 to 60 degree (figure 5). If a SW algorithm‚Äôs coefficients are\ndetermined for the nadir case, then use of same coefficients for all the view angles can\nsignificantly degrade the algorithm accuracy at large view angles. The standard MODIS\nalgorithm addressed this problem (Wan & Dozier, 1996). Here, in the case of Imager\nsensor the view zenith angle can vary nominally up to 50 degree, so we intend to generate\na unique set of split-window coefficients for each view angle sub-ranges (e.g., 00‚Äì200,\n200‚Äì300300‚Äì350, 350‚Äì400, 400‚Äì450, 450‚Äì500 and 500‚Äì550).\nd 297.2\nn\na\nb\nm\nu 296.8\n3\n.1\n1\n3-\n.0 296.4\n1\n,e\nru\nta\nr 296\ne\np\nm\ne\nt\ns s 295.6\ne\nn\nth\ng\nirB 295.2\n0 20 40 60\nView zenith angle, degree\nFigure 5.

The MODTRAN (Berk et al. 1999) was selected for the study because this\nmodel has been long publicly available and its heritage traces back to LOWTRAN\n(Kneizys et al. 1988). It is widely used and validated model for variety of remote sensing\nanalysis and applications across the globe. It uses a more accurate and higher resolution\nmolecular band model based on the Atlas of High Resolution Molecular Spectroscopic\ndata (HITRAN) molecular database. With its spectral resolution capability of 2 cm‚àí1, this\nnarrowband model can perform calculations very accurately with less input requirements\nas discussed by Lacis and Oinas (1991) and Liang (2004). They have shown that using\ntwo narrow spectral ranges of H O and CO (for a resolution of 10 cm‚àí1, and for total gas\n2 2\npressures above 0.1 atm), the correlation accuracy can be improved to better than 1%.\nWith its spectral resolution capability of cm-1 in frequency it simulates at-sensor radiance\nand transmittance as a function of: atmospheric inputs (model atmosphere, atmospheric\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 289\nLand surface temperature\ncolumn parameters, aerosol model etc), surface inputs (emissivity, temperature), viewing\ngeometry and information on spectral channels.\n18.4.3 Data used in the study\nVarious data sets have been used in the present study for generation and validation of\nLST from the INSAT-3D Imager data. This includes the raw Imager data sets (at-sensor\nbrightness temperature, latitude-longitude layers), MODIS emissivity products in two\nspectral channels, K1-LST products and MODIS-LST products. The K1-LST and\nMODIS-LST products were used for comparing the LST images being generated from\nthe INSAT-3D Imager sensor using the proposed method.

(2)\nAtmospheric column water vapour: The water vapour values ranging from 0.1 g/cm2 to\nnear saturated level have been used through each atmospheric profile. (3) Surface\ntemperature: The land surface temperature ranging from 260-330 K has been taken\nkeeping tropical region as the context. (4) View zenith angle (VZA): 0 to 60 degree. (5)\nLand surface emissivity: Emissivity values from the standard International Geosphere\nBiosphere Program (IGBP) land cover types, major 10 major land cover types (ocean\nwater, snow, sand, crop, shrubs, grass, forest, savanna, wetland, urban) have been\nconsidered from the MODTRAN database.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 290\nLand surface temperature\nA set of radiosonde and satellite sounder profiles over tropical region from the SeeBor\ndataset (Borbas et al. 2005; Seeman et al. 2008) is selected for input in MODTRAN\nsimulations. Figure 6 shows a graph of atmospheric profiles covering the boundary layer\natmospheric temperature from 257.4 to 315.3 K and water vapour concentration from 0.1\nto 5 g/cm2 selected in the present study. Synthetic profiles were also generated from these\nbasic profiles by modulating the surface temperature by ¬±10 degree. The attenuation due\nto atmosphere has been considered because of uniformly mixed gases, namely, CO , N O,\n2 2\nO and CH along with the water vapour in the MODTRAN forward simulations. The\n3 4\ncontribution due to solar radiation in the MIR channel is not considered in the simulations.\nAll the transmittance and path radiance calculations were performed in the Imager\nthermal IR spectral channels by incorporating the spectral response function (figure 1) of\nthe respective spectral channel.\n6\n5\n2m\nc\n/g\n,ru 4\no\np\naV\nre 3\ntaW\nra\nn 2\nm\nu\nlo\nC\n1\n0\n250 260 270 280 290 300 310 320\nBoundary Layer Temperature, K\nFigure 6.

Specifically, the relationship between the model input LST and\noutput top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature is fit with an LST algorithm\n(equation 4) via regression to obtain the required coefficients.\n18.5 Results\n18.5.1 Derivation of Split-Window Coefficients (SWC)\nThe satellite-level signals in two TIR channels pertaining to Imager sensor were\nsimulated for varying atmospheric and land surface properties discussed in the above\nsections. In order to determine the SWC a to a in Eq. (4), we divided the VZA into\n0 6\nseveral tractable sub-ranges for improving the fitting accuracy and thus LST retrievals.\nSimulations were performed for VZA ranging from 0 to 60 degree taking into account the\nfact that the Imager sensor onboard INSAT-3D receives radiance from various VZA\nhaving varying atmospheric path length. The SW coefficients (a to a ) of Eq. (4) can be\n1 6\nobtained through statistical regressions method for each VZA sub-range. Seven different\nsets of SWC were determined for each of this VZA sub-ranges, which are summarized in\nthe table 3 and shown in the figure 8.\nTable 3.

The R2 values\nvaried between 0.94 to 0.99 showing good correlation between modelled parameters in\nthe split-window algorithm.\n18.5.2 Sensitivity analysis\nIn order to provide an estimation of the theoretical error on the estimated LST, and also\nthe contribution of the different terms to that error, a sensitivity analysis was performed\nbased on the classical error theory using derivatives. Hence, the contribution to the error\non the LST, e(LST) is given by the following terms:\ne(LST)ÔÄΩ ÔÅ§2 ÔÄ´ÔÅ§2 ÔÄ´ÔÅ§2 (5)\nalg NEÔÅÑT ÔÅ•\nwhere ÔÅ§ is the standard error of the algorithm obtained in the minimization (standard\nalg\nerror of estimation), ÔÅ§ is the contribution of the noise equivalent delta temperature\nNEÔÅÑT\n(NEÔÅÑT) and ÔÅ§ is the error due to the uncertainty of the surface emissivity. These\nÔÅ•\ncontributions are, respectively, given by,\nÔÉ¶ÔÇ∂T ÔÉ∂ 2 ÔÉ¶ÔÇ∂T ÔÉ∂ 2\nÔÅ§ ÔÄΩ ÔÉß s ÔÉ∑ e2(T ) ÔÄ´ ÔÉß s ÔÉ∑ e2(T ) (6)\nNEÔÅÑT ÔÉß ÔÇ∂T ÔÉ∑ i ÔÉß ÔÇ∂T ÔÉ∑ j\nÔÉ® i ÔÉ∏ ÔÉ® j ÔÉ∏\nÔÉ¶ÔÇ∂T ÔÉ∂ 2 ÔÉ¶ÔÇ∂T ÔÉ∂ 2\nÔÅ§ ÔÄΩ ÔÉß s ÔÉ∑ e2(ÔÅ•) ÔÄ´ ÔÉß s ÔÉ∑ e2(ÔÅ• ) (7)\nÔÅ• ÔÉß ÔÇ∂ÔÅ• ÔÉ∑ i ÔÉß ÔÇ∂ÔÅ• ÔÉ∑ j\nÔÉ® i ÔÉ∏ ÔÉ® j ÔÉ∏\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 293\nLand surface temperature\nwhere e refers to the error of the parameter considered in brackets. The different\nderivatives of the T given by Eq. (5) were calculated. Values of e(T)= e(T) = 0.1 K and\ns i j\ne(ÔÅ•) = e(ÔÅ•) = 0.002 have been considered for the present study. These selected values\ni j\nare considered to be representative of typical errors when working in remote sensing.\nThe results on the error and sensitivity analysis obtained for each view angle are\nsummarized in table 4, which includes the contribution to the total error of the different\nterms (ÔÅ§ , ÔÅ§ , and ÔÅ§ ) and the total error in LST, e(LST). The errors on LST have\nalg NEÔÅÑT ÔÅ•\nbeen calculated by applying Eq. (5-7) to each of the thousands of simulated data points.\nTable 4: Results obtained in the sensitivity analysis\nView angle\nÔÅ§ (K) ÔÅ§ (K) ÔÅ§ (K) e(LST) (K)\nSub range alg NEÔÅÑT ÔÅ•\n0 0.68 0.32 0.32 0.82\n30 0.82 0.33 0.32 0.94\n35 0.89 0.33 0.30 1.00\n40 0.98 0.34 0.30 1.07\n45 1.10 0.34 0.30 1.19\n50 1.30 0.35 0.29 1.38\n55 1.52 0.37 0.28 1.59\nAverage 1.04 0.34 0.30 1.14\nGenerally, the accuracy of the SW algorithm is ensured by the standard error of the\nalgorithm (ÔÅ§ ). In this study, the ÔÅ§ values ranged between 0.68 to 1.52 K. An increase\nalg alg\nin the algorithm error was observed as view angle varied from lower to higher values. In\nterms of different contributions to e(LST), it is clearly seen that the less contribution is\ndue to the ÔÅ• uncertainty, with ÔÅ§ values ranging between 0.28 to 0.32 K. The ÔÅ§ ranged\nÔÅ• NEÔÅÑT\nbetween 0.32 and 0.37 K. In terms of total errors on LST, e(LST), values ranged between\n0.82 K to 1.59 K, with an average error of 1.14 K. Looking at the analysis and results\nsummarized in table 3, it is clear that the proposed SW algorithm performs best with\noverall error of 1 K when view angles vary between 0 to 35 degree. Since major of the\nIndian landmass is covered with the view angle up to 35 degree by th e INSAT-3D\nImager (figure 2), we expect to obtain overall modeling error less than 1 K.\n18.5.3 Application of LST algorithm to INSAT-3D Imager data\nA total of 40 raw images of INSAT-3D Imager sensor for every half an hour time period\nof 29th Nov. 2013 were obtained for the analysis. From the raw h5 images, the top-of-\natmosphere (TOA) radiance data corresponding to two split-window channels (TIR1 and\nTIR2) and latitude-longitude layers were extracted from it. The TOA radiance data were\nconverted to the brightness temperature values using the calibration coefficients provided\nin form of look-up-table. Then these brightness temperature layers of two split-window\nchannels were geo-referenced using the latitude and longitude datasets. An example of\nImager standard false colour composite for a daytime (05:30 GMT) is shown in the figure\n9.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 294\nLand surface temperature\nFigure 9. Image composite generated from INSAT-3D Imager data using the combination\nof TIR1, TIR1 and TIR2 channels for Nov. 29, 2013 (05:30 GMT)\nNow the TOA brightness temperature images corresponding to the split-window channels\nwere converted into the LST values using the SWC and proposed method. Here a\nparticular set of SWC was used in the SW algorithm depending upon a VZA sub-range,\ni.e. a unique set of SWC was applied for each of the seven VZA sub-ranges. Figure 10\nshows an example of LST image generated by the proposed method. The LST image\nshown here has been generated by the SW method along with the known emissivity\nvalues generated over India with the help of approximately 20 emissivity tiles of MODIS.\nThe LST products have been generated with a typical spatial resolution of 4 km. A\nspecific land-sea mask was applied to obtain only the landmass covered within the image.\nThe cloudy pixels in the LST products are not masked out in the initial stage. The cloud\nmasking was done in later part of the analysis based upon a bi-spectral thresholding\nmethod and an example of such LST image is shown in figure 11. To demonstrate the\napplicability of our SW method, all 40 images were converted to the LST and for detailed\nanalysis and validation, three images were selected corresponding to daytime (05:30 and\n09:00 GMT) and night time (21:00 GMT) of 29th Nov. 2013 over India.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 295\nLand surface temperature\nK\nNo data 250 260 270 275 279 283 287 291 295 299 303 307 311 315 319 323 327 331 335 340\nFigure 10: Land surface temperature derived with the proposed split-window method for\nINSAT-3D Imager for Nov. 29, 2013 (05:30 GMT) without cloud mask\nK\nNo data 250 260 270 275 279 283 287 291 295 299 303 307 311 315 319 323 327 331 335 340\nFigure 11: Land surface temperature derived with the proposed split-window method for\nINSAT-3D Imager for Nov. 29, 2013 (05:30 GMT) with cloud mask\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 296\nLand surface temperature\n18.5.4 Generation of LST products on diurnal scale\nThis section presents results on the generation of LST products on the diurnal scale over\nIndia and surrounding region. Examples of the 3D-LST images are shown in the figure\n12 for diurnal images acquired on Nov. 29, 2013. The 3D-LST images suggest that LST\nvalues were captured successfully, which ranged from 275-320 K over the Indian region\nfor this particular day.\n00:30 02:30 04:30\n06:30 08:30 10:30\n12:30 14:30 16:30\n20:30 22:30 23:30\nK\nNo data 250 260 270 275 279 283 287 291 295 299 303 307 311 315 319 323 327 331 335 340\nFigure 12. Diurnal LST images generated using a split-window method from INSAT-3D\nImager data over India for Nov. 29, 2013\nAs expected, higher temperatures during daytime were observed mostly in the western\narid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra states of India as well\nas major portion of neighbouring countries having arid regions located in the west of\nIndia. While lower temperatures were observed in the northern parts of India, which are\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 297\nLand surface temperature\nwere dominated by the winter crop regions. An analysis was carried out to obtain diurnal\ncycle of typical land covers in the LST profiles. The idea behind generation of LST on\nthis scale is to check whether the model physics works well throughout the day or not.\nThe diurnal patterns of LST over different land covers such as desert, shrub and crop are\nshown in the figure 13. The patterns resemble to the known behaviour of the LST on\nthese land covers, which confirms that proposed SW method is working well over full\nday-night cycle.\n320\nDesert\n315 Shrubland\nCropland1\nK ,e 310 Cropland2\nru\nta\nre 305\np\nm\neT\ne\n300\nca\nfru\n295\nS\nd\nn\na L\nD\n290\n3\nT A - 285\nS\nN\nI\n280\n275\n03:00 00:20 03:30 00:50 03:60 00:80 03:90 00:11 03:21 00:41 03:51 03:02 00:22 03:32\nTIME (hh:mm), GMT\nFigure 13.

The comparison showed a good\ncorrelation having R2 values varying from 0.73 (05:30 GMT), 0.66 (09:00 GMT) and\n0.79 (21:00 GMT) for 3D Vs. MODIS and from 0.81 (05:30 GMT), 0.80 (09:00 GMT)\nand 0.51 (21:00 GMT) for 3D Vs. K1. While, the standard error of estimates (SEE)\nobserved between 3D and MODIS were 1.84 K (05:30 GMT), 2.27K (09:00 GMT) and\n1.37 K (21:00 GMT). And the SEE observed between 3D and K1 were 1.24 K (05:30\nGMT), 1.37K (09:00 GMT) and 1.10 K (21:00 GMT). It is clear that nighttime retrievals\nshowed an excellent match when the LST ranged between 280 to 300 (figure 21).\nHowever, for the daytime satellite-passes when temperatures were generally more than\n300 K in this part of the globe, 3D-LST showed a deviation as compared to the MOD-\nLST (figure 15 and 18). In the case of satellite pass of 05:30 GMT, the 3D-LST\ndemonstrated a moderate deviation with SEE=1.84 K (R2=0.73) as compared to the\nMOD-LST (figure 15). While 09:00 GMT satellite pass showed a slightly high degree of\ndeviation (SEE=2.27 K, R2=0.66) (figure 18).\nOverall the 3D-LST values showed a good match with the reference LST values in the\nrange of 270-310 K, demonstrating that the SW algorithm is working fairly well.\nHowever, for some of the daytime 3D-LST retrievals (e.g. 05:30 GMT), an unambiguous\nover estimation was observed as compared to MOD-LST retrievals. This overestimation\nin 3D-LST is apparent at all the LST values independent of low or high values in the\ndaytime. Reasons of this overestimation in 3D LST could be: use of India-specific\natmospheric profiles in present study for the RT modelling to obtain better tuning of the\nSW coefficients, difference in the algorithms used, difference in the spatial resolution,\ndifference in time of data acquisition, ignorance of the reflectance term (3rd term of\nequation 1) in the simulation of at-sensor radiance. This reflectance term is quite small\nsince it is multiplied with the downwelling radiance, atmospheric transmittivity and (1-\nemissivity) components. But probably with the presence of solar radiation it may play an\nimportant role, which has to be checked in future analysis. Moreover, there are certain\nissues like cloud masking remain in the present LST retrieval. At many instances in the\npresent analysis, thresholding method for cloud masking does not perform well especially\nover snow regions. A robust cloud-mask algorithm has to be devised and applied to get\naccurate LST products.\n18.7 Conclusions\nThis document presents results of a study to develop a method to generate LST product\nfrom the thermal infrared channels of INSAT-3D Imager sensor over India using a RT\nmodel. A modified split-window algorithm including the view angle correction was\ndeveloped specifically tuned for the Imager sensor. Simulations were carried out based\nupon a number of model inputs to derive a set of coefficients from the atmospheric\nfunctions particularly tuned for the Imager sensor. These SW coefficients were then used\nto generate the LST product. The total theoretical modelling error ranged from 0.8 K (for\nview zenith angle equal to 0 degree) to 1.6 K (for view zenith angle equal to 55 degree)\nwith an average error of 1.1 K. The LST derived using the proposed method was\nvalidated with the Kalpana-1 VHRR LST and MODIS LST products for day and night\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 302\nLand surface temperature\ndatasets. This inter-comparison brought out the fact that the proposed algorithm provided\nencouraging results with a very good match of 3D-LST with other reference LST\nestimates. The comparison of satellite derived LST with other two satellite observations\nover India showed a fairly good agreement between satellite estimates, with a R2 value\nup to 0.79 and RMSE of 1.37 K for 3D Vs. MODIS comparison, while a R2 value up to\n0.81 and RMSE of 1.1 K for 3D Vs. K1 comparison. The overestimation in the case of\ndaytime observations in the 3D LST is to be explored in the future. A robust cloud\nremoval algorithm has to be developed and applied on the LST images. The method\ndeveloped in this report provides a theoretical base for generation of operational LST\nproducts over India from the INSAT-3D Imager data.\nAcknowledgement\nThis study has been carried out under the INSAT-3D Utilization Project ‚ÄúRetrieval of\nland surface temperature from the INSAT-3D Imager observations‚Äù.

One of the distinguishing factors of ET is its role as a key player between\nthe energy and water cycles. The potential ET rate (ET ) is influenced by several factors\no\nsuch as solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature and vapour pressure deficit. Among\nthem, solar radiation is the most sensitive parameter influencing almost 60-70%\nvariability of ET . The potential evapo-transpiration (PET), hereafter referred as grass\no\nreference evapo-transpiration (ET ),is expressed in terms of amount of water transferred\no\nper unit time to atmosphere from water non-limiting surface covered with a uniformly\nand actively growing short grass such as Alfalfa. ET represents the evaporative demand\no\nof the atmosphere for a given climatic region. Deficiency in required supply of moisture\nleads to water stress. Reference evapo-transpiration is an agrometeorological variable\nwidely used in hydrology and agriculture. Together with precipitation, it is a major input\nin soil water balance models. Several of these models require daily or hourly evapo-\ntranspiration data to provide acceptable estimate of plants‚Äô water requirements. This\nwould provide regional water demand in different agro-climatic settings and agricultural\ngrowing season. The combination of spatial rainfall with ET would help in monitoring\no\nwater deficit and surplus during a growing season for rainfed agriculture.\nSome contours of monthly climatic ET have been generated by Department of\no\nAgricultural Meteorology, IMD (India Meteorological Department) from measurements\nof limited surface observatories in India. But interpolation from such contours will\npropagate large errors. No digital map of ET is available to scientific community,\no\nmodelers, resource managers and planners in India. Moreover, real-time updated spatial\nET product at weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and monthly scales would aid in knowing the\no\nintra and inter-seasonal climatic variability of water stress factors and their impact on\ndeviation in biomass and yield. The climatic moisture index (ratio of rainfall and PET) is\nessential to know surface wetness and suitability of sowing or transplanting operations.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 309\nPotential evapotranspiration\nTherefore, it has the relevance for national agro-advisory services to farmers as well as\ncrop forecasting.\n19.2.1 Overview and background\nThe latent heat of vaporization, which is the energy required for evaporating water is\nsignificant in weather and climate dynamics (Priestley & Taylor, 1972; Monteith,1973;\nRowntree, 1991; Anderson et al., 2007). Although the concept of ‚Äúevaporation‚Äù has been\nknown since approximately 500 B.C. (see Brutsaert, 1982 for a chronological sketch),\nmost of the understanding of the governing factors has been achieved in the last two\ncenturies. Dalton (1802) was the first who proposed relationship of vapor pressure deficit\n(e ‚àíe ) of the near surface air to the evaporation rate. Later, many empirical\nsat act\nrelationships were developed based on other environmental factors (Blaney and Criddle,\n1950; Hargreaves, 1975; Thornthwaite, 1948). Based on available energy considerations\nand turbulent flux theory, Penman (1948) developed his evaporation equation for natural\nsurfaces for water non-limiting conditions. This is known as potential evapotranspiration\n(PET). Monteith (1964) developed a modified version of the Penman equation in which\nbiophysics was introduced through a surface or canopy resistance ‚Äì the now well-known\nPenman‚ÄìMonteith (P-M) combination equation ‚Äì that allowed for vegetation control on\ntranspiration rates.\nChoudhury (1997) proposed a method to assess by means of satellite data, such as\nremotely sensed solar radiation, air temperature (derived from infrared images and\nweather station measurements) and vapor pressure deficit. This method provides good\nevapo-transpiration estimates for low-resolution applications such as worldwide scale and\nmonthly time step. The accuracy is limited by the high uncertainties provided by satellite-\nsensed vapor pressure estimation.\nLater, Bois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation from METEOSAT\nobservations from Heliosat-2 approach (Rigollier et al. 2004) and air temperature data to\nestimate ET using Hargreaves approach. The ET can also be available as forecast bi-\no o\nproduct from weather forecasting model. However, recent evaluation of predicted\nradiative fluxes and operational short-range forecasts (24 hrs average) of routine weather\nelements from model for a limited winter months showed that the incident shortwave\nradiative flux produced the highest root mean square error to the tune of 110%\n(Bhattacharya et al, 2012a) amongst others as compared to in situ measurements from\nINSAT-linked micrometeorological stations (popularly known as AMS). However, the\nerrors of short-range forecast of air temperatures, relative humidity, atmospheric\npressure, wind speed at 10 m height were 3%, 12%, 21% and 1.4% respectively over\nplain and pleateu regions. The per cent RMSE for last four variables were found to\nincrease in the hilly terrain (Bhattacharya et al, 2012a). Expectedly, the ET would have\n0\nsubstantial errors propagated mainly from incident solar radiation flux estimation. on the\nother hand, the operational product on daily insolation from Kalpana-1 VHRR produced\naround 25% RMSE (Bhattacharya et al, 2012b) with respect to same ground reference\nand the per cent RMSE decreased with averaging over weekly, ten-day, fortnightly and\nmonthly scales up to 15%. After improvement in the cloud flagging and the spatial\nresolution of operational insolation product from INSAT 3D, it is expected to produce\nsubstantially less errors. Therefore, it seems wise to use the combination of daily\ninsolation product from INSAT 3D and operational forecasts of air temperatures, relative\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 310\nPotential evapotranspiration\nhumidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure to generate real-time digital and regional\nproduct of potential evapo-transpiration.\n19.2.2 Objectives\nThe objectives of this document are :\n(i) To outline the algorithm for the estimation of potential evapo-transpiration (ET )\no\nbased on Penman-Monteith (P-M) approach (FAO-56 model)\n(ii) To integrate operational product of daily insolation from INSAT 3D and 24 hrs\naverage operational forecast of routine weather elements at finer spatial resolution\nto generate product of spatial ET at 5 km spatial resolution\no\n(iii)To implement the algorithm in IMDPS GPR (Geophysical Parameter Retrieval)\nchain for automation of ET product generation\no\n(iv) To describe validation strategy against in-situ measurements with initial results\n19.2.3 Instrument and characteristics of input products\n19.2.3.1 Indian geostationary satellite (INSAT 3D)\nThe Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of\nSpace (DOS), Department of Telecommunications (DOT), and India Meteorological\nDepartment (IMD). INSAT 3D is an exclusive meteorological satellite in the INSAT\nsystem, which was launched at geostationary orbit in 2013. This radiometer consists of\nfour bands : broad VIS (0.52-0.75), SWIR (1.55-1.70), MIR(3.8-4.0), WV(6.5-7.0) and\ntwo thermal TIR1(10.2-11.2), TIR2 (11.5-12.5) with nineteen sounder channel. The\nspatial resolution of VIS and SWIR band is 1 km x 1 km and 4 km x 4 km for MIR,\nWV and two thermal IR bands. The introduction of INSAT Meteorological Data\nProcessing System (IMDPS) provides both ‚Äòfull-globe‚Äô and ‚Äòsector‚Äô data products in all\nthe bands at half-an-hour interval at 4 km spatial resolution in an automated mode. So,\nthere are maximum 48 acquisitions on a given day. Raw data after reception at each\nacquisition were corrected for servo, line-loss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling\nremoval using the INSAT 3D data products scheduler. This results into automated\ngeneration of co-registered data in each band at Transverse Mercator (TM) projection.\nThe dimension of each band at each acquisition is 676 rows x 721 columns for Asia\nMercator sector product.\n19.2.3.2 Operational insolation product\nA spectrally integrated clear-sky and three-layer cloudy-sky models were developed to\ndetermine integrated atmospheric transmittances and instantaneous insolation. Half-an-\nhourly observations from an Indian geostationary satellite sensor, INSAT 3D, were used\nto provide minimum ground brightness (surrogate of surface albedo) from previous 30\ndays, cloud top albedo, brightness temperatures, atmospheric water vapour as inputs to\nthese models in addition to global eight-day aerosol optical depth at 550 nm and\ncolumnar ozone. A trapezoidal scheme was implemented to obtain daily insolation (in\nMJm-2) from half-an-hour instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) throughout the day for all-sky\nconditions (clear + cloudy). The whole algorithm (Bhattacharya et al, 2010 & 2012b) will\nbe operationalized and daily insolation product can available at 4 km spatial resolution\nwith Transverse Mercator projection routinely from MOSDAC site\n(http://www.mosdac.gov.in).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 311\nPotential evapotranspiration\n19.2.3.3 Operational product of WRF short-range forecast\nWeather Research and Forecasting (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) Model version 3.1 is\nused for All India Short range weather forecast. WRF is a limited area, non-hydrostatic,\nprimitive equation model with multiple options for various physical parameterization\nschemes. This version employs Arakawa C-grid staggering for the horizontal grid and a\nfully compressible system of equations. The terrain following hydrostatic pressure co-\nordinate with vertical grid stretching is followed in vertical. The time-split integration\nuses 3rd order Runge-Kutta scheme with a smaller time step for acoustic and gravity wave\nmodes. The WRF physical options used in this proposal consists of the WRF Single\nMoment 6-class simple ice scheme for microphysics (WSM6); the Grell-Devenyi\nensemble cumulus convection parameterization scheme; and the Yonsei University\n(YSU) planetary boundary layer scheme.\nThe WRF Model is integrated in a triple domain configuration with a horizontal\nresolution of 45 km, 15 km and 5 km for the All India, with grid points 260√ó235,\n352√ó373 and 676√ó721 in x and y directions for the domains 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The\nmodel has 36 vertical levels with the top of the model atmosphere located at 10 hPa. The\nWRF 3D-Var is used for the assimilation of all available conventional including ISRO-\nAWS data and satellite observations to improve the model initial conditions. The\noperational WRF short-range forecasts (Kumar et al., 2011), available at MOSDAC site\nused climatological land surface and atmospheric parameters from global database and\nassimilated all available conventional including ISRO-AWS and satellite observations\n(Kumar et al., 2011; Singh et al., 2011) from Indian and other International agencies (e.g.\nEUMETCast). The operational forecast is available at finer spatial resolution (~ 5km) at\nthree hourly interval upto 72 hours.\nExamples of operational daily insolation product and 24 hrs average WRF forecast\nproduct of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and atmospheric pressure over\nIndian region are shown in Figure 1.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 312\nPotential evapotranspiration\nFigure 1.

This\ncombination method was further extended to vegetated surface by introducing resistance\nterm. The aerodynamic and surface resistances have been added to the original equation\nof Penman to estimate Potential evapotranspiration (ET ) from a surface.

Example of monthly distribution of ET from VHRR insolation and WRF\n0\nforecasts over Indian region\n19.7.1 Sensitivity of P-M model to weather variables for error budgeting\nThe sensitivity of P-M model ET was carried out by Bois et al (2008) using ‚ÄòSobol‚Äô\n0\nmethod. It consists of numerous simulations of the models using two independent\nsamples of ‚ÄòN‚Äô repetitions (rows) and ‚Äòk‚Äô input variables (columns), retrieved from\nexisting data or randomly generated data from the probability distribution function (PDF)\nof each ‚Äòk‚Äô input variable. One or several variables in the first sample are substituted by\nthe same variable (s) taken from the second sample. For each of the (2k - 1) possible\ncombinations of variable substitutions between the two samples, ‚ÄòN‚Äô runs of the model\nare computed. The sensitivity of the model to input variables was based on so-called\nsensitivity or Sobol‚Äô indices, which were calculated on the principle of the decomposition\nof the total variance (V) of the model output, in response to individual or simultaneous\nvariations of the ‚Äòk‚Äô model inputs.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 320\nPotential evapotranspiration\nIn oceanic climate, the results of monthly sensitivity analyses computed using Southwest\narea (SW) data show clear seasonal trends (Figure 4). During the winter period (from\nNovember to February), wind speed is the main source of variation in ET values\n0\ncalculated using P-M method (e.g. 38% of ET total variance in January). Then come\n0\nrelative humidity and air temperature (32% and 17% of ET total variance in January,\n0\nrespectively). Solar radiation, daily amplitude of air temperature and daily amplitude of\nrelative humidity have little impact on evapo-transpiration process during winter. This\ntrend changes during March and October. From April to September, ET is mostly\n0\nsensitive to solar radiation (up to 74% of ET total variance in May, and 70% in July).\n0\nFrom May to July, P-M formula is not very sensitive to relative humidity, air temperature\nand their diurnal amplitudes. Mean daily air temperature participate from 11% to 15% of\nET variance, from May to September. Total sensitivity indices show that, when added to\n0\nother variables‚Äô variations, air temperature has a greater impact on ET variability during\n0\nsummer, and wind speed has a greater impact during winter (Figure 4B).\nIn Mediterranean climate, sensitivity of ET computation to climate input variables using\n0\nP-M method in Southeast area (SE) is very close to the one observed. Wind speed as a\nmajor impact on ET calculation during winter and solar radiation is clearly the most\n0\ninfluent variable during summer (Figure 4C and D). The present analysis highlights the\ngreat sensitivity of this Penman‚ÄìMonteith formula to solar radiation during summer\nperiod, when ET reaches its highest values, and when its calculation is critical for\n0\nirrigation process and ecological modelling. These results were obtained for\nMediterranean and Oceanic climate, at medium latitudes. A recent work published by\nGong et al. (2006) on a large range of climatic conditions in Southern China leads to\nsimilar results, except for relative humidity which had a greater impact on ET during\n0\nwinter than it has been shown in the present study. Considering the results of Penman‚Äì\nMonteith sensitivity to solar radiation, it seems reasonable to evaluate the benefits of\nsatellite-sensed solar radiation to ET calculation.\n0\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 321\nPotential evapotranspiration\nFigure 4.

To validate satellite based regional ET estimates, the\no\nmeasurements from INSAT-linked AMS (Agro-Met-Station) data were used\n(Bhattacharya et al, 2009). The AMS provides all radiation and meteorological variables\nat 30 minutes interval and represent a fetch area of 1 km x 1 km. The AMS data from six\nsites over different agro-climatic zones were used to compute ET on daily basis for\no\ndifferent time period as listed in Table 6.

Daily scale\nDaily ET estimated using P-M approach was compared with daily ET computed from\no o\nAMS measurements for different agro-climatic regions as listed in Table 6. The 1:1 plot\nis shown in Figure 5 and temporal comparison is shown in Figure 6. The daily ET\no\ncomputed from AMS varied from 0.7 mm to 12.0 mm while satellite derived ET varied\no\nfrom 1.1 to 11.7 mm over different seasons for selected stations. The error analysis\nshowed the root mean square deviation (RMSD) varied from 1.13 to 3.82 mmd-1 to the\ntune of 21 to 38 % of measured mean over six stations (Table 7). The overall pooled data\nset showed RMSD of 1.34 mmd-1 with 29% deviation from measured mean. This was due\nto high fluctuation of ET on daily temporal scale as shown in Figure 5 for all six AMS\no\nstations. The estimated daily ET showed underestimation as well as overestimation for\no\nall AMS stations but extent of temporal pattern matches quite well in all the stations.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 323\nPotential evapotranspiration\nFigure 5. 1:1 scatter plot between daily ET from AMS and estimates from satellite and\no\nWRF\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 324\nPotential evapotranspiration\n(f)\nFigure 6.

This seasonal change of ET was well captured in the estimates. The\no\noverall RMSD was found to be 10.5 mm (27.4 % of AMS mean) on January to April with\nrespect to AMS.\nThe central plateau and hill agro-climatic region is represented here by AMS at\nPowarkheda site. The area falls under the catchment of Narmada where annual rainfall\nvaries from 800 to 1200 mm. The wheat crop is dominant during rabi season. The\nestimated dekadal ET estimates matched well throughout January to May. The dekadal\no\nhigh and low value matched quite well and estimated ET always remained high as\no\ncompared to AMS ET up to March during growth of wheat crop. After that, estimated\no\nET underestimated measured ET . In January, both showed low values in the range of\no o\n30 to 37 mm and 35 to 46 mm but goes up to 97 to 103 mm (AMS) and 82 to 94 mm\n(estimated) in May. The temporal profiles matched quite well and showed RMSD of 10.4\nmm over ten days (16.6% deviation from AMS mean).\nThe typical Indian arid region lies in western, dry agro-climatic region and represented\nhere by Jaisalmer. The climate remains hot throughout the year except in January and\nFebruary. The data over monsoon season (July, August and September) were used for\ncomputation of ET . In this part of India, S-W monsoon starts in July and it was well\no\ncaptured by dekadal ET variation during stated months. During July, ET remained\no o\nhigher but later in the season it reduced in both the cases. The satellite estimated ET\no\nshowed both underestimation and overestimation for selected season as compared to\nAMS. The temporal profile of ET of two followed the same pattern. The RMSD of 6.3\no\nmm was found for monsoon season which is 10.2% with respect to AMS ET .\no\nThe southern part of India, AMS located in LPSC Mahandragiri represents the natural\nscrub vegetation. The AMS data for January to May and August to November were used\nfor comparison with AMS ET value. The temporal profile of dekadal ET matched well\no o\nwith AMS ET . The difference between two was maximum during north-east monsoon\no\nseason (January to February) but later on, the difference was reduced further in May and\nNovember. The data showed a RMSD of 9.4 mm (21.4% deviation of measured AMS\nmean).\nThe island agroclimatic region of Andaman & Nicobar have different climatic conditions\nas compared to above stated regions. As this region is surrounded by Bay of Bengal so\nclimatic condition remains humid throughout the year. The data from March to May and\nAugust to November were used for comparison. The AMS ET on an average had a range\no\nof 23 to 50 mm throughout the selected time domain. Similar order of magnitude was\nobserved for estimated ET . The dekadal behaviour of estimated ET matched well with\no o\nAMS ET but showed little higher deviation during August and September.

The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured\nET gradually increased from daily to 10-day but maximum increase was observed from\no\ndaily to 7-day i.e from 8% to 23% for six AMS stations. The rise of correlation\ncoefficient from 7-day to 10 days was nominal in Nariangarh (PAU) (0.7%), Chakdah\n(BCKV) (2%), Pawarkheda (2.3%) and Jaisalmer (6.3%) as compared to LPSC\n(Mahandergiri) (13.8%) and Diglipur (12.6%) as shown in Figure 8. Similarly per cent\ndeviation from mean of AMS measurements also showed a similar trend as the deviation\ndrastically came down from daily to 7-days and further nominal decrease in 10-day\nexcept than in Jaisalmer. For the latter, it decreases from 14.8% to 10.2% for 7 to 10-days\nas marked in Figure 9. The analysis showed that error was significantly reduced from\ndaily to 7-days and further in 10-days over different agro-climatic zones. This will help\nus use this ET data in various applications on different time scales with known errors.\no\nFigure 9.

He has compared the estimated ET with lysimeter data\no\nand on monthly scale the error was found between 15 to 40% from measured mean.\nBois et al. (2008) used remotely sensed solar radiation and weather data from AWS\nequipped with humidity, thermal sensors and cup anemometer to estimate ET using\no\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 330\nPotential evapotranspiration\nFAO-56 P-M method. They used the solar radiation prepared from Meteosat data by\nfollowing Heliosat-2 method (Rigollier et al. 2004). The study found that most of the\nerrors occurred in partial cloudy days due to uncertainties in retrieving daily solar\nradiation. On daily scale, the RMSD was between 0.34 to 1.32 mm (11% to 110% from\ndaily mean) but on annual scale the RMSD remained low (11% of ET mean value) at\no\n0.05o X 0.05o spatial resolution. This error again came down to (9.1% to 5% of ET mean\no\nvalue) during clear days in summer. Our study was unique as we used operational\nproduct of K1VHRR insolation WRF 3-hourly forecast for at 0.05¬∞grid for estimation of\nET at 0.08o X 0.08o. On daily scale, RMSD was 1.1 to 3.8 mm (21% to 38% from\no\nmeasured mean) but it came down to 10% to 28% from mean on dekadal time scale and\nfurther in monthly scale (21% from monthly mean). The overall error at different\ntemporal domain were found in good harmony with reported errors in other part of world.\n19.8 Sources of errors / uncertainties in ETo estimates and validation issues\nThe following sources of uncertainties were traced out while evaluating spatial output of\nET estimates and its comparison with ground reference\no\n(i) Influence of vegetation in AMS\nThe FAO 56 P-M method is generally applied for a specific site using meteorological and\nradiation data from meteorological observatories or AWS weather data including direct\nmeasurement of radiation. In India, ISRO-AWS does not provide solar radiation data in\nterms of standard energy units. IMD AWS provide data with some lag period. The\nsensitivity analysis of P-M method by Gong et al. (2006) and Bois et al. (2008)\nhighlighted that solar radiation and wind speed were clearly the most influent variables\nfor ET estimation. The pyranometer and routine weather data from AMS are used. But\no\nthese measurements were recorded over different vegetation cover types. Since\nvegetation growth influences ambient weather conditions, the ET computed from AMS\no\nwould definitely have differential vegetation influence when compared to ET estimates\no\nfrom integration of satellite based solar radiation and WRF forecast weather variables.\n(ii) Scale mismatch\nSpatial ET was generated at approximately 8 km spatial resolution with 64 km2 pixel\no\narea while the average footprint of AMS varies from 0.25 to 1 km2. This scale\nmismatch puts constrain in validation statistics. But this scale mismatch will reduced with\nINSAT 3D.\n(iii) Difference in time sampling\nFor spatial ET , daily solar radiation was generated from diurnal observations at\no\ninstantaneous snapshots with half-an-hour interval from satellite platform. But half-an-\nhourly averages from AMS measurements were used to generate validation datasets\n(iv) Accuracy in cloud flagging\nThe product version of surface insolation algorithm has cloud detection capability of\napproximately 80%. It could not detect thinner clouds. Therefore, ET estimates have\no\nhigher errors during the period more cloudy spells or for AMS sites with higher cloud\ndynamics such as Diglipur (A & N), LPSC, Mahendragiri etc.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 331\nPotential evapotranspiration\n(v) Quality of WRF forecast\nAn initial evaluation of WRF forecast quality showed an average error to the tune of 1-\n2¬∞C, RH of 5-10% as compared to large error in wind speed and predicted radiation terms.\nThe inherent errors in first three variables will have implications on the overall error\nbudget.\n19.9 Future scope of improvement\nRecent improvement has taken place in the cloud detection of INSAT 3D insolation\nalgorithm using additional criteria based on cloudiness index from VIS band observations.\nMuch of the uncertainties in insolation and ET estimates in cloudy-skies will hopefully\no\nbe improved.\nRecent study on impact of updated vegetation fraction from INSAT 3A CCD showed\nimprovement in air temperature, humidity and rainfall forecast from WRF. The use of\nreal-time satellite based other land surface products such as albedo, LAI and soil moisture\nwould definitely help in improving the quality of operational forecasts. Future work\nshould address the retrieval / estimation of those variables from Indian geostationary\nsatellites.\nThe INSAT 3D will provide relatively finer spatial resolution of observation of insolation.\nThis would reduce the scale mismatch uncertainty for validation.\n19.10 References\n1.

It is composed of direct and\ndiffuse components. While reaching the ground from top-of-atmosphere solar radiation\nis attenuated by different atmospheric constituents such as water vapour, ozone, aerosol,\nair molecule, clouds and fogs through scattering and absorption processes. The molecular\nscattering by air molecules is known as Rayleigh scattering. The aerosol scattering is Mie\nscattering. The component of solar radiation that reaches earth surface without deviation\nfrom original direction is known as direct or beam insolation. The component of solar\nradiation reaching earth surface after scattering is known as diffuse insolation. Diffuse\ncomponent is composed of three components such as : Rayleigh scattered, aerosol\nscattered and reflected multiple scattered insolation. Clouds play major role in attenuating\nsolar radiation while reaching earth surface. It is accountable for 70% depletion of solar\nradiation depending on its type, distribution and ice-cloud proportioning of three-\ndimensional vertical structure. Moreover, aerosol acts as cloud condensation nucleii\n(CCN). The contribution of clouds towards diurnal variability of insolation is more than\naerosol and atmospheric gases specially during monsoon season. Fog also plays an\nimportant role in attenuating solar radiation in the winter. The interaction of solar\nradiation with atmospheric constituents and clouds is shown in Figure 1.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 337\nSurface insolation over land\nFigure 1: Interaction of incident solar radiation (irradiance) with major atmospheric\nagents for its depletion in clear and cloudy skies\nSurface insolation is the driving input for eco-physiological processes such as\nevapotranspiration (Jacobs et al, 2000) and photosynthesis (Chen et al, 1999). The\ntrapped energy through formation of ATP and NADPH in ‚Äòlight reaction‚Äô is utilized in\nthe ‚Äòdark reaction‚Äô of photosynthesis to produce carbohydrates. The photosynthetic\nresponse of plant species to different light intensity determines primary productivity,\ntherefore, it is as critical component to assess bio-energy and bio-fuel resources.\nInsolation is the major contributor of earth‚Äôs radiation and energy budget. It is also a\ncrucial input to crop simulation model for yield forecasting.\nIn climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, use of renewable energy resources\nsuch as solar energy plays important role to maintain a emission-free green and safe\nenvironment. Monthly solar radiation maps on spatial scale are very important to locate\nsolar energy conversion systems such as solar PV or thermal power plants (Janjai et al,\n2005). Conventionally, these maps are constructed from high density network of\npyranometers. However, in India, a very sparse network of pyranometer stations is\npresently operating. Interpolation from such sparse network produces large errors (60-\n70%) due to large uncertainties of intermittent diurnal cloud cover, cloud types and\natmospheric turbidity in cloudless skies. Moreover, high maintenance costs and lack of\navailability of real-time data are major impediments. Several estimation models have\nbeen developed based on temperature amplitude, sunshine hours or cloud cover and\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 338\nSurface insolation over land\ncombination of temperature, humidity, rainfall, but these require site and season specific\ncalibration coefficients and thus difficult to extrapolate. Moreover, such models do not\nexplicitly consider the role of atmospheric constituents such as air molecule, aerosol,\nwater vapour, ozone. The use of remote sensing observations from geostationary satellite\nsensors that have high temporal sampling frequency (multiple passes every day) are ideal\nto capture spatio-temporal variability of surface insolation for those regions where\nregular measurements from sparse radiation network and their availability are not\nconsistent till date.\n20.2.1 Overview and background\nBroadly, two approaches such as (a) statistical or empirical (Tarpley, 1979; Noia et al,\n1993) and (b) physical or radiative transfer (Tanahashi et al, 2001) schemes are in use to\nestimate surface insolation using geostationary satellite data using broad visible band and\nthermal infrared bands. Empirical or statistical techniques for surface insolation include\nHeliosat (Dagestad, 2004), contrast ratio (Rosema et al, 2004) approaches applied to\nMeteosat. Heliosat model has been developed under Helioclim project of Europe and has\nundergone several revisions. It is based on deriving cloudiness index from maximum,\nminimum albedo in a time series and current albedo. This cloudiness index is converted\ninto surface insolation through clearness index (ratio of surface insolation and insolation\nat-top-atmosphere) using pre-determined empirical relations. Physical modelling schemes\nof clear sky insolation are of two types: (i) ‚Äòtop-down‚Äô approach that corrects incoming\nsolar irradiance (Pinker and Lazlo, 1992; Lu et al, 2010) for atmospheric attenuation\n(absorption and scattering) before reaching the surface (ii) ‚Äòbottom-up‚Äô approach that\ndetermines surface albedo (Gautier et al, 1980) from planetary albedo by separating out\natmospheric interferences and arrive at surface insolation through inversion. Several\nschemes are available to account for attenuation of solar radiation flux passing through\nclouds either using cloud top albedo or reflectivity that represents cloud backscatters or\nfrom combination of cloud-top albedo or temperature or cloud optical thickness and\ncloud-top pressure. Spectrally integrated irradiance model and three-layer cloudy scheme\nwere implemented with Kalpana-1 VIS, WV and thermal IR bands to estimate\ninstantaneous and daily insolation (Bhattacharya et al, 2012 and 2013). Statistical models\nare only based on visible band observations while physical model requires inputs from\nboth visible and thermal bands in addition to determination of cloud mask. While the\nerrors of statistical techniques varied from 12‚Äì17% for daily total insolation (Kandirmaz\net al, 2004), the physical approach produces error of about ¬± 19% on hourly basis and\nlesser for daily to monthly averaging. Moreover, the statistical models call for region-\nspecific updates of coefficients through ground datasets which are time consuming.\n20.2.2 Objectives\nThe objectives of this document are :\n(i) To outline a physical algorithm for surface insolation estimation\n(ii) To highlight the sensitivity of algorithm and evaluation of estimates from\nthis algorithm applied with Kalpana-1 VHRR data\n(iii) To describe the path of integrating algorithm with Indian geostationary\nsatellite (e.g. INSAT 3D) based on cloud properties, aerosol, water vapour\nand ozone products\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 339\nSurface insolation over land\n(iv) To implement the algorithm in a software compatible to IMDPS geophysical\nparameter retrieval chain for automated generation of instantaneous and\ndaily insolation\n(v) To describe validation strategy of operational product of INSAT 3D\ninsolation against in-situ measurements, reanalysis data, other satellite\nproducts\n(vi) To outline the scope of improvement in the accuracy of the estimates in\nfuture\n20.2.3 Instrument characteristics\nThe Indian National Satellite (INSAT) system is a joint venture of the Department of\nSpace (DOS) and India Meteorological Department (IMD). It provides half-an-hour\nobservations from six channel ‚ÄòImager‚Äô and 19-channel ‚ÄòSounder‚Äô. The Imager has one\nbroad VIS (0.55-0.75 ÔÅ≠m) band (1 km x 1 km), one SWIR (1.55 ‚Äì 1.70 ÔÅ≠m) band (1km\nx 1km), one MIR (3.8 ‚Äì 4.0 ÔÅ≠m) band (4 km x 4 km), one water vapour (6.5 - 7.1ÔÅ≠m)\nband (8 km x 8 km) and two split thermal (10.2 - 11.3 ÔÅ≠m, 11.5 - 12.5 ÔÅ≠m) bands (4 km\nx 4 km). The sounder has 19 channels to provide vertical profiles of atmospheric\ntemperature and humidity. There are 22 geophysical products which are scheduled to\nbe available from an operational processing known as INSAT Meteorological Data\nProcessing System (IMDPS). This has been successfully implemented in Kalpana-1\nVHRR and INSAT 3A VHRR and CCD (Anonymous, 2005). This system provides\nboth ‚Äòfull-globe‚Äô and ‚Äòsector‚Äô data products. Presently, there are 40 acquisitions against\na maximum of 48 acquisitions per day. Raw data after reception at each acquisition are\ncorrected for servo, lineloss, radiometry, stagger and oversampling removal using data\nproducts scheduler. These result into automated generation of co-registered data with\nfixed projection having fixed number of rows and columns.

This accounts for depletion of instantaneous incoming solar\nradiation flux due to atmospheric perturbances or turbidity. In cloudy-sky, a separate\nthree-layer scheme was implemented where cloud is assumed plane parallel sandwitched\nbetween upper and lower cloudless atmospheric layers.\n20.4.1. Clear-sky model\n20.4.1.1 Direct or beam irradiance . A simple but accurate spectral irradiance\nmodel (Paulescu and Schlett 2003) was used to determine instantaneous direct or beam\nirradiance (in Wm-2) over the entire shortwave range (0.3 to 3 ÔÅ≠m). An integrated spectral\n(10 nm interval) atmospheric transmittance scheme developed by them was used in the\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 342\nSurface insolation over land\npresent study. The instantaneous direct or beam irradiance over the entire\nshortwave region was computed in Wm-2 as,\n(1)\n= (2)\nWhere, = ozone transmittance, Rayleigh transmittance, water vapour\ntransmittance, aerosol transmittance, transmittance of other gases, = solar\nconstant (1367 Wm-2), = Instantaneous irradiance (Wm-2) at top-of-atmosphere, =\ncalendar day\nThe Rayleigh transmittance, , was computed as,\n(3)\nThe was computed over 10 nm interval and integrated over whole shortwave\nspectrum.

(2010) based\non differences in brightness temperatures in thermal IR and WV channels of Kalpana-1\nVHRR. The aerosol optical depth at 550 nm from MODIS product was converted to\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 344\nSurface insolation over land\nAngstrom ‚ÄòŒ≤‚Äô turbidity parameter to compute aerosol transmittance assuming Angstrom\nturbidity exponent parameter as 1.3 ( Iqbal 1983 ). The ozone data from MODIS was\nused to compute ozone transmittance.\nThe monthly minimum ground brightness from previous thirty days VIS band planetary\nalbedo was dynamically determined for each acquisition and was used as\nsurrogate for ground albedo The planetary VIS band spectral albedo was corrected\nfor Rayleigh scattering. The aerosol scattering effect and cloud interferences on planetary\nalbedo were assumed to be removed with monthly minimum composites understanding\nthat surface properties have not changed significantly within thirty days. The multiple\nscattering component contributes little to total diffuse irradiance over vegetated region\n(albedo between 0.1 and 0.3) but is a dominant component over snow bound areas or\ndesert ( > 0.3) with significantly higher albedo.\n20.4.1.3 Global or total irradiance\nBoth direct and diffuse irradiance are dependent on the zenith angle of the sun that\nchanges from sunrise to sunset and on the orientation of the surface. On an arbitrarily\ninclined surface with slope, ÔÅ° , and aspect, ÔÅ™ , at a given location on earth surface with\nlatitude, ÔÅ¶, the angle between the incident radiation and the normal to the surface is\nexpressed as ,\n(12)\n(13)\nÔÅ§ = solar declination angle (radian)\nh = sun hour angle (radian)\nDepending on the terrain properties and solar geometry, the surface may be in the shadow\nof nearby topographic features; is then assigned a value of zero that represents no\ndirect irradiances. Diffuse radiation was assumed to be isotropic in distribution in the\natmosphere, i.e. the sky is uniformly bright. Depending on the slope and nearby\ntopography, only a fraction of hemisphere might be visible, which is referred as the sky-\nview factor , which is time invariant and is dependent only on terrain parameters.\nThe total or global irradiances (Wm-2) received on surface at any instance is\ngiven by,\n(14)\nThe is determined as the ratio of diffuse sky irradiance to that on an unobstructed\nsurface. In present algorithm, this was computed using expression given by Kondratyev\n(1977).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 345\nSurface insolation over land\n= (15)\n20.4.2. Cloudy-sky model\nA three-layer scheme was conceptualized and implemented to compute irradiances in\ncloudy skies. The first layer corresponds to clear-sky atmosphere over cloud-top where\ndirect and diffuse components were computed using algorithm mentioned in section 3.1.\nMolecular (above cloud) and aerosol scattering, gaseous transmission due to ozone were\nconsidered. Entire aerosol and ozone were assumed to be distributed above cloud. Both\ndirect and diffuse components were computed and the sum of these two resulted into\nglobal irradiances without any sky-view factor. The second layer corresponds to plane\nparallel cloud. The vertical cloud structure and its three-dimensional effects on cloud\ntransmission especially on diffuse component were not considered in the present model.\nThe third layer corresponds to clear-sky atmosphere below cloud. Molecular scattering\n(air below cloud) was only considered in layer 3. The precipitable water was assumed\nentirely distributed below cloud and contributed to gaseous transmission along with other\ngases.\nIn order to compute Rayleigh scattering above cloud, the height of cloud-top was\napproximated from cloud-top temperature, maximum clear-sky planetary temperature\nwithin previous 30 days, ground elevation and dry-adiabatic lapse rate up to condensation\nlevel represented through cloud-top temperature. Here also, direct, diffuse and global\nirradiances were computed using the principles used in the section 3.1. The irradiance\ncoming out of first and top clear-sky layer after attenuation is considered as the incoming\nsolar radiation flux cloud layer. The energy flux that comes out after being attenuated in\ncloud layer was considered as influx for third layer (clear-sky layer below cloud) which\nagain gets attenuated to reach at the ground. The global irradiance received at the ground\nis considered as insolation in cloudy-sky.\nThe transmission through cloud was computed using Kubelka-Munk theory.\n(16)\nThis relates cloud-top albedo with cloud transmittance ( . The coefficients\nin the equation 16 vary according to different land use categories which were\ntaken into account through typical ranges (< 0.2 for water bodies, forest; 0.21 to 0.32 for\nagriculture; >0.3 for desert and snow cover) of ground albedo represented by minimum\nground brightness from previous thirty days.\n20.4.3 Daily integration\nA trapezoidal integration was applied to construct daily integral from diurnal\ninstantaneous global irradiances. The daily integral global irradiance was expressed in\nMJm-2. The mathematical expression for daily integration is:\n(17)\nHere represents hours in GMT.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 346\nSurface insolation over land\n20.4.4 Flow chart\nFigure 3\n20.4.5 Operational implementation\nStep 1: Unpacking and pre-processing\nFirst sub-program should unpack h5 (Hierarchical data format) datasets from INSAT 3D\nImager, reads DEM and computes date, time, year from name of file string as well as\nsun-sensor zenith, azimuth angles. Brightness temperatures in IR and WV bands and VIS\nalbedo (after removing perturbation due to molecular scattering) were also computed\nfrom look-up table (LUT) and calibration coefficients provided with h5 datasets.\nStep 2 : Generation of minimum ground brightness and maximum brightness\ntemperatures for cloud-fog detection and cloud height determination\nThis sub-program uses INSAT 3D ‚ÄòImager‚Äô brightness temperatures and VIS band\nalbedo or reflectance of a lead of previous 30 days. The maximum temperatures and\nminimum albedo were picked up for each pixel at a given acquisition. Both are used as\nbi-spectral thresholds to detect cloud. In addition, a cloudiness index is generated through\nnormalization of VIS band TOA reflectance, its upper and lower limts. Both dynamic\nbispectral thresholds and threshold of cloudiness index ( > 0.15) are used to for cloud and\nfog detection and masking during daylight hours. Temperature composites and current\nacquisition temperature will be used to determine cloud height from dry-adiabatic-lapse-\nrate (DALR)\nStep 4 : Interpolation of climatic gridded AOD , ozone and resampling\n550\nAnother sub-program should use eight-day gridded (1¬∞ x 1¬∞) climatological aerosol\noptical depth (AOD) and ozone to extract from global products for the latitude and\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 347\nSurface insolation over land\nlongitude bounds of south-east Asia corresponding to K1VHRR Asia Mercator sector\ncoverages. These can be resampled down to 8 km spatial resolution using bilinear\ninterpolation and reprojected to INSAT 3D Imager projection.\nStep 4 : Generation of time series instantaneous insolation\nThe main program should compute time series instantaneous global (direct + diffuse)\ninsolation for a given acquisition using the outputs from other sub-programs, clear-sky\nand cloudy-sky models.\nStep 5 : Daily integration\nAnother program should perform trapezoidal integration of both bias-uncorrected and\nbias-corrected instantaneous insolation at 23:30 hrs GMT on a given day. This program\nshould fetch instantaneous insolation from different acquisitions on a given day and make\na list. This program should first check at least one acquisition within two hours and then\ndaily integration should be performed. It means that If at least well distributed five\ninstantaneous insolation are available in the list, the integration is performed.\nThe whole algorithm has been implemented with Kalpana-1 VHRR data from 2012 to\ngenerate operational products on insolation after the clearance by ATBD review\ncommittee set-up by Director, SAC and in-house T & E has also been carried out.\nThe same algorithm was applied with INSAT 3D ‚ÄòImager‚Äô data to estimate instantaneous\ninsolation over limited datasets\n20.5 Outputs\nTable 5\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nA.

This was carried\nout with the observed seasonal range of AOD, water vapour and ozone over station\nBijapur. The effects of change in aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD ) were studied\n550\nat low (10-20¬∞) and high (40-70¬∞) levels of solar zenith angles (Figure 5a).\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 350\nSurface insolation over land\nFigure 5a. Sensitivity of the clear-sky insolation model to aerosol optical depth\nThere was substantial and similar trend of decrease in both global (15-20%) and direct\n(25-30%) instantaneous insolation for a given range of AOD (0.05 to 0.6), but the gap\n500\nbetween direct and global is reduced at higher solar zenith angle. The steepness of slopes\nof direct insolation was more negative (-0.67 Wm-2) than global insolation (-0.35 Wm-2).\nThe slopes were less negative (-0.48 Wm-2, -0.35 Wm-2) at higher solar zenith angle for\nboth the cases. Diffuse insolation, in general, showed gradual increase with increase in\nAOD but it reached plateau at higher solar zenith angle with AOD beyond 0.2.\n500 500\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 351\nSurface insolation over land\nDiffuse fraction was found to show sharp increase between 0.12 to 0.28 and 0.18 to 0.38\nat low (17.46ÔÇ∞) and high (41.1ÔÇ∞) solar zenith angles with increase in AOD between 0.1\n500\nto 0.6. But the higher diffuse fraction was noticed at higher solar zenith angles for similar\nAOD . It was found that there was practically little decrease (3-7%) in global, direct\n500\nand diffuse insolation with increase in water vapour between 1.5 to 6.5 cm (Figure 5b).\nThe decrease was still less for ozone (Figure 5c) varying between 240 to 290 dobson\nunits.\nFigure 5b.

One year data from at least 10 locations of AMS\nover different climatic conditions will be used. The selection criteria for choosing quality\nvalidation datasets are described below :\na) Days with daily insolation estimates constituted from at least one instantaneous\ninsolation per hour between 00 GMT to 1300 GMT will only be used for\nvalidation. These maintain diurnal symmetry to produce reliable daily integral\nb) The days with in situ continuous half-an-hourly measurements are retained for\nvalidation. The days with any data loss due to communication failure will be\nrejected.\nc) Diurnality and seasonality checkings will be carried out\nd) Error statistics in the form of bias, root mean square error (RMSE) and\ncorrelation coefficient will be generated.\n20.7.2.2 Comparison with other sources of spatial data\nComparison with other sources of insolation product over India or overlapping region\nsuch as insolation from MSG over Africa or insolation from GMS partly over Indian sub-\ncontinent, reanalysis product for one year and generation of error statistics, histogram\nmatching\n20.7.3 Validation results\n20.7.3.1 Initial validation of instantaneous insolation estimates from limited\nobservations of INSAT 3D ‚ÄòImager‚Äô\nIn this study, INSAT 3D instantaneous surface insolation was compared with in situ\nmeasured incoming shortwave radiation by four-component net radiometer (model :\nCNR-1) placed at AMS at a height of 4 m from ground. The transmitted data through\nINSAT 3A were received at Bopal Earth Station (BES). The in situ data at half-an-hour\ninterval for Hyatnagar (17.82¬∫N, 78.98¬∫E), Andhra Pradesh, Chakdah (23.06¬∫N, 88.54¬∫E),\nWest Bengal, Sriharikota (13.62¬∫N, 80.22¬∫E), Andhra Pradesh, Hoshangabad (22.70¬∫N,\n77.75¬∫E ), Madhya Pradesh, Khazwal (23.53¬∫N, 93.18¬∫E), Mizoram, Chilika (19.71¬∫N,\n85.19¬∫E), Orissa were used to validate the INSAT 3D based estimates. The data coverage\nwas good for AMS at Hyatnagar and Hoshangabad. The AMS data coverge was less in\nrest of the locations. Altogether 90 (ninety) datasets could be obtained from AMS for\nvalidation for the period 1 to 15 October 2013.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 354\nSurface insolation over land\nFigure 10. Validation of INSAT 3D instantaneous insolation with limited measurements\nfrom AMS\nThe operational product (K1-VHR-INS) of instantaneous insolation estimates at 8 km\nspatial resolution from Kalpana-1 VHRR were obtained for 0330, 0500, 0530, 0600,\n0630, 0700, 0730, 0800, 0830, 1130 for 1 to 15 October 2013 were obtained through\nMOSDAC (http://www.mosdac.gov.in). The mean insolation from diurnal instances of\nKalpana-1 VHRR was compared with mean insolation from ‚ÄòImager‚Äô.\nA comparison was made between insolation estimates averaged over 3 x 3 pixels (~ 12\nkm x 12 km) and in situ point measurements from Agro-Met Station (AMS) at coincident\ntimings during 1 to 15 October 2013. There was significant correlation (r = 0.72) between\nthese two from 90 paired datasets (Figure 6). This showed a mean bias of 37 Wm-2 and\nRMSE of the order of 16.8% of measured mean from AMS. The RMSE has been reduced\nsubstantially as compared to reported RMSE (25%) of instantaneous insolation from\nKalpana-1 VHRR estimates averaged over 64 km x 64 km and with respect to AMS-\nbased point measurements. The scatter of points around 1:1 line could be due to\ndifferences in scale mismatch between estimates and measurements leading to loss of\nsub-pixel cloud heterogeneity.\nA qualitative comparison (Figure 7) was made between ‚ÄòImager‚Äô and VHRR insolation\nfor 0730 GMT on 13 October 2013 to look into the impact of better resolution (0.04 deg)\nof ‚ÄòImager‚Äô on insolation specially in cloudy patches.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 355\nSurface insolation over land\nFigure 7.

Difference in mean instantaneous insolation (Wm-2) in cloudy patches on 13 October 2013\nbetween INSAT 3D ‚ÄòImager‚Äô and Kalpana-1 VHRR\nFiner gradation of insolation variation was seen over central India and Phailin affected\neastern India in case of ‚ÄòImager‚Äô as compared to Kalpana-1 VHRR with 8 Km spatial\nresolution.\nThe difference of mean instantaneous insolation over cloudy patches (Figure 8) in eastern\nIndia on 13 October 2013 between ‚ÄòImager‚Äô and VHRR is shown in Figure 8. Majority of\nthe difference was in the range of 10 ‚Äì 30 Wm-2.\n20.7.3.3 Sources of uncertainties\nThe possible sources of uncertainties that contribute to errors in K1VHRR daily\ninsolation estimates are outlined below :\nInput levels\n(i) Inherent accuracies of products of aerosol, atmospheric water vapour\n(ii) Inaccuracy of cloud and fog mask\n(iii) Uncertainty of periodic updation of calibration coefficient of VIS band\nModel structure\n(iv) Cloud-top reflectivity is considered, no cloud absorption is considered for cloud\nattenuation\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 357\nSurface insolation over land\n(v) Attenuation under fog is treated same as cloud over ground\n(vi) Diffuse insolation from cloud is not considered\nGround validation\n(vii) Scale mismatch between estimates and measurements\nThe insolation product will be generated at 4 km spatial scale which may not\nsometimes capture the sub-pixel variability of thin haze, clouds or early morning or\nlate afternoon fog and their influence on insolation which can be captured through\npyranometers at tower foot-print scale of few meters. The use of estimates averaged\nover 3 X 3 pixels for validation with measurements at tower foot-print scale may be\nvalid for cloudless skies. But it may lead to underestimation if cloud patches are\npresent and irregularly distributed in the surrounding pixels but not in the central\npixel. It may lead to overestimation if cloudy patches are only present in the central\npixel representing tower location but not in the surrounding pixels.\n(viii) Difference in temporal sampling\nThe ISRO-AMS observations on incident shortwave radiation were sampled at 5\nminutes interval and averaged over half-an-hour. Imager will sample with\ninstantaneous snapshots at 30 minutes interval. Therefore, it misses out intermittent\ncloud presence and its spatio-temporal dynamics. These differences must have\nintroduced some uncertainties in the validation results.\nSensitivity analysis showed little influence of ozone and water vapour content on\ninsolation at different solar zenith angles. But strong sensitivity of AOD at 550 nm was\nobserved on insolation. Single scattering albedo ( was assumed 1.0 in the present\nmodel. In reality, it varied between 0.7603 to 0.9921 among urban-rural-ocean aerosol\ntypes (Li 1998).\n20.8 Limitations of algorithm and issues in operational scenario\nPresent algorithm has the following limitations :\nÔÇ∑ The present algorithm does not consider scattering of incoming solar radiation\nwith raindrops. Therefore, it will lead to inaccuracies in cloudy-sky conditions\nwith rain occurrence.\nÔÇ∑ Cloud has different proportions of liquid water and ice. Attenuation by them\nindividually is not considered.\nÔÇ∑ Under cloudy-sky conditions a constant precipitable water of 5.5 gcm-2 was\nassumed which may not be always true.\nÔÇ∑ All aerosols were assumed to be distributed above cloud. Perturbations by\naerosols below cloud were not considered.\nÔÇ∑ Ground brightness and cloud top albedo are represented by minimum VIS TOA\nalbedo of previous 30 days. Instead, minimum shortwave albedo needs to be used.\nÔÇ∑ Apart from the above, the sources of uncertainties enumerated in the validation\nsection (section 1.6.3.1) are the sources of inaccuracies.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 358\nSurface insolation over land\n20.9 Future scope of improvement\nÔÇ∑ Megha-Trophique (MT) ScaRaB data can be utilized to know the relation\nbetween VIS spectral albedo and shortwave albedo radiance, fluxes which will\nhelp in computing shortwave albedo including surface and cloud-top. The relation\ncan be extended to INSAT VIS band data to know the minimum ground\nbrightness.\nÔÇ∑ Revised cloud transmission should be introduced separately for different cloud\ntypes of low, medium and high level for different background land types.\nÔÇ∑ The near-real time diurnal aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550nm from INSAT 3D\n‚ÄòImager‚Äô would help minimize the uncertainities introduced by aerosol\nclimatology. The network of diurnal measurements of aerosol optical depth and\nits other properties from 10 IMD land stations or AERONET over India can be\nexplored to offset bias in AOD estimates. The real-time availability of these data\nwould help remove the residual bias.\nÔÇ∑ Bias correction model would be developed from validation results from one year\ndatasets and will be applied later to improve the accuracy.\nÔÇ∑ Quality flag should be tagged with insolation product.\n20.10 References\n1.

Geopotential Height\n1.1 Algorithm Configuration Information\n1.1.1 Algorithm Name\nGeopotential Height (GPH)\n(Ref : IMD RFP Section 12.3 )\n1.1.2 Algorithm Identifier\nISRO_INSAT_GPH_A001\n1.1.2 Algorithm Specification\nVersion Date Prepared by Description\n1.0 14.02.2007 B Simon GPH\n1.2 Introduction\n1.2.1 Overview and background\nGeopotential height fields (GPH ) at a pressure level indicate the source and sinks of air\nmasses. Generally high pressure areas have relatively higher geopotential heights than\nlow pressure areas. It is also a fundamental quantity that is used in atmospheric general\ncirculation models. At mid-latitudes they also indicate the underlying large-scale waves\nsuch as Rossby waves. By looking at the geopotential heights one can infer the first guess\natmospheric wind pattern (also known as geostrophic approximation) especially for mid-\nlatitudes.\n1.2.2 Objective\nTo derive geopotential heights at 40 pressure levels from 1000 hPa to 0.1 hPa.\n1.3 Inputs\n1.3.1 Static Data\nTopographic data at sounder horizontal resolution.\n1.3.2 Dynamic Data\nRetrieved temperature and humidity profiles at 40 pressure levels\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 366\nApplication parameters from sounder derived products\n1.3.3 Other auxiliary and Model Inputs\n1000 hPa analysed heights from IMD or ECMWF/NCEP or surface pressure and surface\ntemperature.\n1.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n1.4.1 Theoretical Background\nGiven pressure, temperature and humidity profile from surface to 0.1 hPa, height of any\npressure level or thickness of atmospheric layer from surface to a particular pressure level\ncan be computed using the formula\nR T P\nZ ÔÄΩ d v ln( s)\ng P\nP ‚Äì Surface Pressure, P ‚Äì Given pressure where geopotential height is to be calculated,\ns\nT - Layer mean virtual temperature. This can be computed at all the retrieved pressure\nv\nlevels.\nVirtual temperature T is given by T ÔÄΩ(1ÔÄ´0.61q)T where q is specific humidity\nv v\nexpressed in Kg/Kg, T is temperature in K.\nGeopotential height (GPH) is then given by\nR Z\nGPH ÔÄΩ o\nR ÔÄ´Z\no\nWhere R = 6356.766 km, the average radius of the earth. By using H instead of Z, one\no\ncan use g = 9.8 ms-2, a constant value in calculations. In reality, g decreases slightly with\naltitude. Difference between Z and H can be as much as 16m at the height of 10 km\nabove sea level depending on pressure, temperature and humidity profile. Error in Z\ndepends on error in retrieved temperature, specific humidity profiles as well as the\nsurface pressure from analysis. Assuming pressure estimates are error free, a 0.5 K error\nin estimation of layer mean virtual temperature results in about 10 meter error in Z. Thus\nthe error in Z is very much dependent on the uncertainties in the retrieved temperature\nand specific humidity profiles (Roland Stull, 2000).\n1.4.2 Operational Implementation\nOnce temperature and humidity profiles are available from surface and all 40 standard\npressure levels, Z can be estimated from the formula described in the previous section.\nLayer mean virtual temperature (between pressure levels p1 and p2) may be estimated by\nusing the formula\n(log p1).T ÔÄ´(log p2).T\nT ÔÄΩ 10 v1 10 v2\nv log (p1.p2)\n10\nWhere p1, p2 are pressure levels (p2<p1), T , T are virtual temperatures at p1 and p2\nv1 v2\nrespectively.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 367\nApplication parameters from sounder derived products\nThis may be carried out starting from the surface to subsequent levels in steps of one\npressure level each.\n1.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nGPH Meters - - +/- 10 m 0.5 x 0.5 deg\n1.5.1 Format of the output and the domain\nLatitude, Longitude, Pressure (1000 to 0.1 hPa), GPH.\nDomain: 50 S to 50 N, 30 E to 130 E.\n1.6 Validation\n1.6.1 Data required\nCo located radiosonde measurements of temperature, humidity and geopotential heights.\nGeopotential heights from NCEP/ECMWF reanalysis.\n1.6.2 Methods of Validation\nDifference between radiosonde/reanalysis geopotential heights, mean bias, standard\ndeviation etc are calculated.\n1.7 Technical Issues (limitation etc.)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the retrieved temperature and\nhumidity profiles. A simple calculation assuming a surface pressure of 1000 hPa shows\nthat a 0.5 K error in T will result in about 10 m error in 500 hPa geopotential height. To\nv\na first approximation, error in T is of the same order of T. Hence achieving less than 10\nv\nm error in 500 hPa geopotential height demands that errors in retrieved temperatures be\nless than 0.5 K.\n1.8 References\nMeteorology For Scientists and Engineers, Roland Stull, 2000, Brookes/Cole (Pub.), 502\npp.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 368\nApplication parameters from sounder derived products\n21.2.

Presence of\nair mass lightens the air mass thereby increasing the potential for convective activity. As\nan air parcel rises, it cools dry adiabatically until saturation vapor pressure is reached.\nOnce saturation vapor pressure is reached some of the water vapor condenses forming\nliquid droplets, and releasing latent heat. This latent heating reduces the amount of\ncooling and makes the air parcel more buoyant. This information is very essential for\naccurate prediction of weather and goes as an input parameter in numerical weather\nprediction models.\n2.2.2 Objective\nTo compute layer precipitable water in three layers i.e. 1000hPa-900 hPa, 900-700 hPa,\nand 700-300 hPa and total precipitable water in the vertical column of atmosphere\nstretching from surface to about 100 hPa.\n2.3 Inputs\n2.3.1 Dynamic data\nRetrieved specific humidity at standard pressure levels.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 369\nApplication parameters from sounder derived products\n2.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n2.4.1 Theoretical Background\nLayer precipitable water may be computed using the formula\np2 q\nPW ÔÄΩ ÔÉ≤ dp\ng\np1\nwhere p1 and p2 are bounding pressures of each layer in Pa, q ‚Äì specific humidity in\nKg/Kg. Total precipitable water is also computed from the same formula with p1 as\nsurface pressure and p2 as top of the atmosphere pressure (i.e. about 100 hPa beyond\nwhich water vapor amount is assumed to be in negligible). Unit of precipitable water is\nmm depth of equal amount of liquid water above a surface of one square meter (if\npressure is in Pa and specific humidity is in Kg/Kg).\n2.4.2 Operational Implementation\nFor practical purposes the above integral is evaluated numerically i.e. integral expression\nis replaced by summation.\np2 q\nPW ÔÄΩ ÔÉ• ÔÅÑp\ng\npÔÄΩp1\n2.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nPW mm 0 100mm 25% 0.5 x 0.5 deg\n2.5.1 Format of the output and the domain\nlat, lon, PW (at three layers) and TPW (total precipitable water vapor).\nDomain: 50 S to 50 N, 30 E to 130 E.\n2.6 Validation\n2.6.1 Data Required\nCo located radiosonde observations, Total precipitable water from ground GPS receivers,\nand radiometers wherever available.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 370\nApplication parameters from sounder derived products\n2.6.2 Methods of validation\nDifference between the observational (radiosonde, GPS receiver and radiometer) and\nINSAT-3D derived PW and TPW are computed along with standard error statistics.\n2.7 Technical Issues (Limitations etc.)\nRMS error of 4-6 mm and mean bias of 1 mm (as required by IMD) will depend on the\nerror levels of retrieved specific humidity profile.\n2.8 References\nMeteorology For Scientists and Engineers, Roland Stull, 2000, Brookes/Cole (Pub.), 502\npp.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 371\nApplication parameters from sounder derived products\n21.3. Lifted Index from Sounder\n3.1 Algorithm Configuration Information\n3.1.1 Algorithm Name\nLifted Index from Sounder (LIS)\n(Ref : IMD RFP Section 12.6 )\n3.1.2 Algorithm Identifier\nISRO_INSAT_LIS_A001\n3.1.3 Algorithm Specification\nVersion Date Prepared by Description\n1.0 14.02.2007 B Simon LIS Baseline document\nD Jagadheesha\n3.2 Introduction\n3.2.1 Overview and background\nLifted index is an indicator of convective activity. It is calculated in the following steps.\n1. Mean boundary layer (usually lowest 100 hPa layer) temperature and humidity\nare calculated.\n2. A parcel of air with the above calculated temperature and humidity is lifted from\nthe middle of the boundary layer dry adiabatically up to lifting condensation level\nand then moist adiabatically up to 500 hPa.\n3. The environmental temperature minus the parcel temperature at 500 hPa\ncalculated in the above step is the lifted index (LI).\nIf the parcel temperature is warmer than the environmental temperature it indicates that\nthe parcel can rise further on its own and LI will be negative. Based on a large number of\nLI calculations from radiosonde observations, it is observed that LI less than -5 implies a\nvery strong likelihood of thunderstorm activity. Time sequence of geographical pattern of\nLI may be monitored to study large scale convective activity and its relation to synoptic\ncirculation systems (Hayden et al., 1996).\n3.2.2 Objective\nTo calculate Lifted Index (LIS) from temperature and humidity profiles retrieved from\nthe INSAT sounder.\n3.3 Inputs\n3.3.1 Dynamic Data\nSounder retrieved temperature and humidity profiles at standard pressure levels.\n3.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n3.4.1 Overview\n3.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\nGiven boundary layer pressure, specific humidity and temperature, one can lift the parcel\nto 500 hPa dry adiabatically up to lifting condensation level (LCL) and from LCL to 500\nhPa moist adiabatically and thereby compute the parcel temperature at 500 hPa.\nEnvironmental temperature at 500 hPa is the retrieved temperature at 500 hPa. Lifted\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 372\nApplication parameters from sounder derived products\nIndex is then the difference between the 500 hPa parcel temperature and environmental\ntemperature.\nMoist adiabatic lapse rate (saturated adiabatic lapse rate) is given by (Meteorology for\nScientists and Engineers, by Roland Stull, 2000)\nÔÅÑT (aT ÔÄ´cq)\nÔÄΩ\nÔÅÑP P(1ÔÄ´(bq/T2))\nWhere a=0.28571, b=1.35 x 107 K2, c=2488.4 K, T ‚Äì Temperature in K, P ‚Äì Pressure in\nkPa, q ‚Äì specific humidity in g/Kg.\nStarting at a temperature T , at pressure P , temperature at pressure P , can be written as\n1 1 2\nÔÅÑT\nT ÔÄΩT ÔÄ´ (P ÔÄ≠P)\n2 1 ÔÅÑP 2 1\nThe difference P -P should be small enough so that the moist lapse rate does not change\n2 1\nsignificantly. Thus one can estimate parcel temperature step by step at higher levels, by\nthis method. Error in the Lifted Index calculated this way will depend on error in\nretrieved temperature and humidity profile.\n3.4.2 Operational Implementation\nImplementation of the above described algorithm is self explanatory.\n3.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nLIS oC - - 2-3oC 0.5 x 0.5 deg\n3.5.1 Format of the output and the domain\nlat, lon, LIS\nDomain: 50 S to 50 N, 30 E to 130 E.\n3.6 Method of Validation\n3.6.1 Data Required\nCollocated radiosonde observations\n3.6.2 Methods of Validation\nDirect comparison with LI calculated from collocated radiosonde observations.\n3.7 Technical Issues (Limitation etc.)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the retrieved temperature and\nhumidity profiles from the sounder.\n3.8 References\nHayden, C.

In regions such as the western Great Plains of the United States (e.g. near\nDenver), the environmental air is often so dry that evaporative cooling causes dangerous\ndowndraft called downbursts. Hazardous downbursts can occur even under cloud bases\nwhere precipitation evaporates before reaching the ground. The smaller-diameter but\nintense downbursts are called microbursts. Downbursts of 0.5 to 5 km in diameter have\nbeen observed. For extreme cases, downdraft speeds of nearly 10 m/s have been observed\n100 m above ground. This is particularly hazardous to landing and departing aircraft,\nbecause this vertical velocity can sometimes exceed aircraft climb rate. Doppler radars\ncan detect some of the downbursts and give early warning to pilots (Roland Stull, 2000).\nIn India dry desert regions, elevated plains, mountain regions where air is very dry may\nbe susceptible to microburst. Generally dry microburst occurs in situations characterized\nby high convective cloud bases and strong evaporational cooling in the sub-cloud layer,\nresulting in little or no precipitation at the surface.\n4.2.2 Objective\nTo compute dry microburst index based on an empirical formula.\n4.3 Inputs\n4.3.1 Dynamic Data\nRetrieved temperature and humidity profile at standard pressure levels.\n4.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n4.4.1 Overview\n4.4.1.2 Theoretical Background\nDry microburst index is generally calculated using the formula,\nDMI ÔÄΩÔÅáÔÄ´(T ÔÄ≠T ) ÔÄ≠(T ÔÄ≠T )\nd 700 d 500\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 374\nApplication parameters from sounder derived products\nÔÅá - lapse rate (oC km-1) of the layer from 700 hPa to melting level (i.e. layer at 0o C), T ‚Äì\nTemperature (oC), T ‚Äì Dew point (oC). Usually DMI is not calculated for any retrieval\nd\nunless the following three conditions are satisfied:\n(1) ÔÅá > 6 K km-1 ( somewhat stable for convective activity)\n(2) (T - T ) >= 8 K (implies a very dry atmosphere close to surface)\nd 700\n(3) (T-T ) <= 8 K (implies some level of saturation at this level)\nd 500\nSuitability of these conditions needs to be studied for the Indian region.\n4.4.2 Operational Implementation\nOperational implementation simply involves evaluation of the quantities in the formula\nDMI ÔÄΩÔÅáÔÄ´(T ÔÄ≠T ) ÔÄ≠(T ÔÄ≠T ) .\nd 700 d 500\n4.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nDMI - - 2-3oC 0.5 x 0.5 deg\n4.5.1 Format of the output and the domain\nLat, Lon, DMI\nDomain: 50 S to 50 N, 30 E to 130 E.\n4.6 Validation\nDoppler weather radar observations of dry micro burst index may serve as validation tool.\nWind shear data from aircrafts may also give some data for validating dry microburst\nindex.\n4.6.1 Data Required\nDoppler weather radar observations of dry micro burst events may be useful in validation.\nWind data during aircraft landing may also give some indication of dry microburst events\nwhenever they occur which may also be used for validation.\n4.6.2 Methods of Validation\nConventional/direct comparison of computed and observed quantities.\n4.7 Technical Issues (Limitation etc.)\nAs the index is based on observations over USA where Great Plains with a very dry air\nexists, applicability over Indian region may require slight modifications. For instance\nmore emphasis may be given to study of meteorological conditions leading to dust storms,\netc. and development of suitable indices. As the sounder gives vertical profiles of\ntemperature and humidity only over cloud free regions, one may not be able to detect\nsuch events from sounder retrievals.\n4.8 References\nMeteorology For Scientists and Engineers, Roland Stull, 2000, Brookes/Cole, 502 pp.\nPryor, K.L., Ellrod, G.P., and A.A., Bailey, 2002: Convective downburst potential using\nGOES sounder derived products.

The\nmaximum vertical ÔÅ± differential between the boundary layer and middle troposphere is a\ne\nmeasure of atmospheric instability in the vertical direction. Larger the theta-e differential,\nmore unstable is the atmosphere in the vertical direction. A quantity called dry microburst\npotential index (MDPI) is calculated by dividing thetaed by 30. As this formula for MDPI\nis empirical, its suitability over the Indian region needs to be studied.\n5.2.2 Objective\nTo calculate thetaed from sounder retrieved temperature and humidity profile.\n5.3 Inputs\n5.3.1 Dynamic Data\nTemperature and humidity profiles retrieved from the sounder.\nINSAT-3D ATBD Document, May 2015 376\nApplication parameters from sounder derived products\n5.4 Algorithm Functional Specifications\n5.4.1 Overview\n5.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\nEquivalent potential temperature (ÔÅ± ) is defined as\ne\nLq\nÔÅ± ÔÄΩÔÅ±exp( )\ne C T\np\n(See section 5.2.1 for details).\nIt is different from potential temperature in the sense that it is dependent on the moisture\ncontent (moisture content provides additional energy in the form of latent heat release).\nIts values will be high at lower levels due to presence of water vapor and decreases as\none reaches middle troposphere.

Aerosols have large-\nscale effects, such as their impact on climate by redistributing solar radiation (Herman\nand Browning 1975; Charlson et al. 1991; Haywood and Boucher 2000) and interacting\nwith clouds (Platnick and Twomey 1994; Kaufman et al. 2002). Aerosol information is\nalso critical for atmospheric correction algorithms for multi-spectral satellite sensors and\nmilitary operations. The climate effects of atmospheric aerosols may be comparable to\nCO greenhouse effects, but with opposite sign and larger uncertainty (Hansen and Lacis,\n2\n1990). Aerosols have a significant impact on human life beyond the climate element.\nWhen in the lower troposphere, aerosols cause poor air quality, reduction of visibility,\nand public health hazards. Satellite remote sensing provides a means to derive aerosol\ndistribution at global and regional scales.\nThis Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) describes the updated algorithm\nused to retrieve the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOD) for the INSAT-3D/3DR Imager\ninstrument operating from a geostationary platform. In comparison to previous algorithm\n(see INSAT-3D AOD ATBD version-1&2), the present algorithm (version-3, Mishra et\nal, 2018) is significantly different both in terms of surface reflectance characterization as\nwell as aerosol inversion. The updated algorithm has several advancement, which has\nimproved the AOD product. Following points are some of the important features of the\npresent algorithm that makes it advanced and improved in comparison to previous\nversions:\na) Previous algorithm utilizes single scattering approximation (SSA) that is it do not\nconsider multiple scattering, while in present algorithm exact radiative transfer\ncalculation are done considering multiple scattering events also.\nAerosol\nb) In previous versions, minimization of 30-day top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance is\nassumed as surface contribution, while here minimization of Rayleigh corrected TOA\nreflectance is used for generating clear composite image (CCI).\nc) In previous version CCI image is directly used as surface reflectance, while in present\nalgorithm CCI image is first atmospherically corrected using dynamic (seasonal and\nspatial) background aerosol database (generated using multiyear MODIS aqua AOD data)\nto generate surface reflectance which is then used for AOD inversion.\nd) Previously perfectly scattering aerosol type is assumed for both ocean and land (for\nland it is rarely valid), while in updated algorithm for AOD inversion continental and\nmarine aerosols are used for land and ocean, respectively.\ne) In previous versions, AOD retrieval done for all pixel even over bright surface where\nin principle retrieval is not possible using band centered at red (650nm) wavelength,\nwhile in current version AOD retrieval is done only for those pixel where surface\nreflectance is less than critical reflectance. Thus, false retrievals such as AOD retrieval\nover very bright surface (like desert or bare arid soil surfaces or high reflecting urban\nsetups) are reduced/masked.\nf) Current algorithm gives AOD product at 550 nm.\nThe output product description is summarized in Table 1. Specifically, this document\nidentifies the sources of input data, both INSAT-3D/3DR imager and non- INSAT-\n3D/3DR imager data, required for retrieval; provides the physical theory and\nmathematical background underlying the use of this information in the retrievals;\nincludes implementation details; and describes assumptions and limitations of the\nproposed approach.\nTable 1: Summary of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) product\nParameter Units Horizontal Cell Comments\nName Size\nAerosol Optical Dimensionless 10.0 km for both Retrieved for all cloud free\ndepth at 550 nm Land and oceans regions.\n10.2.2 Objective\nThe objective of this algorithm is to calculate the aerosol optical thickness, proportional\nto the total aerosol loading of the ambient aerosol, over both land and ocean for Indian\nregion on a six times (6:00, 6:30, 7:00, 7:30, 8:00 and 8:30 UTC) daily basis.

Thus, satellite reflectance measurement limited to one (GOES) or two channels\n(Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer [AVHRR]) were used first to derive the\ntotal aerosol content by assuming a given aerosol model.\nThe relatively homogeneous surface of the ocean enables the direct application of the\nlook up table (LUT) approach to find the aerosol optical thickness. Using the observed\nreflectance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) in coordination with ancillary information\non the wind speed, water vapor, surface pressure, surface elevation, and ozone, the\ncorrected reflectances are inverted into a maritime LUT to find values of optical\nthickness.\nThe approach over land is more complicated, in that dark, vegetated surfaces are required\nfor aerosol optical depth retrieval. In dark vegetation approach for aerosol retrieval a\nnear-IR band is used to identify dark, vegetated pixels, then the surface reflectance in the\nvisible bands is calculated from the observed reflectance in the near-IR band. The optical\nthickness is initially calculated assuming a continental aerosol model. The suspended\nmatter information is used to choose a better aerosol model and more accurate values of\noptical thickness (Kaufmann et al. 1997).\nIn spite of advances in aerosol remote sensing over land, most retrievals are limited to\nonce or twice per day, as by the morning and afternoon passes of the orbiting polar\nsatellites. Aerosols, however, show diurnal variations that would be missed by such\nsparse observations. While studies of aerosol optical depth from Sun photometers show\nlittle systematic trends (Smirnov et al. 2002), surface observations of scattering show\nsignificant diurnal patterns (Bergin et al. 2001). It is required to understand aerosol plume\nmovement to track and forecast plume movement in the interest of human health.\nTherefore, it is important to monitor the temporal aspects of aerosol.\nThe INSAT-3DR imager data from geostationary platform has the potential to provide\naerosol observations over land and ocean with multiple observations per day. Many\nstudies have demonstrated the potential of Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellite (GOES) series of imager sensors to provide quantitative estimates of aerosol\noptical (Knapp et al. 2002, Knapp et al. 2005). Their sensitivity studies, however,\nconcluded that retrievals depend on aerosol optical property assumptions and surface\nreflectance. Studies using newer geostationary satellites (e.g. GOES-8) and larger\nvalidation networks (e.g. Aerosol Robotic Network‚ÄîAERONET) supported those initial\nAerosol\nfindings. Specifically, Zhang et al. (2001) and Knapp et al. (2002) showed that aerosol\nmonitoring from GOES is possible for South America. However, this region has optimal\nretrieval conditions: surface cover with little variability (i.e. rainforest) and large aerosol\noptical depths (from biomass burning).\nStudies by Knapp et al. (2005) have shown operational potential of GOES series of\nsensors for the monitoring of aerosol optical depth over land. A method is proposed by\nKnapp et al (2005) to correct surface effects and retrieve aerosol optical depth using\nvisible reflectance measurements from the Geostationary Operational Environmental\nSatellite (GOES). The surface contribution is determined from temporal compositing of\nvisible imagery, where darker pixels correspond to less atmospheric attenuation and\nsurface reflectance is deduced from the composite using radiative transfer. The method is\napplied to GOES-8 imagery over the eastern US. Retrieved surface reflectance is\ncompared with separate retrievals using a priori ground based observations of aerosol\noptical depth.\n10.4.1.1 Theoretical Background\nThe INSAT-3DR imager data will be used to perform the surface reflectance and aerosol\noptical depth retrievals and mask for clouds. It measures top of the atmosphere (TOA)\nradiance in six channels: three at infrared wavelengths, one in the visible wavelength and\none sensitive to both solar and Earth-emitted radiance. Primarily, the visible channel\n(0.52‚Äì0.72 mm full width at half maximum) is sensitive to aerosol scattering and\nremaining channels are used for cloud masking. The cloud mask algorithm is based on\nthe Clouds from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) (CLAVR)\nalgorithm (Stowe et al. 1999) which uses spectral and spatial thresholds to test for the\npresence of clouds.\nThe retrieval of aerosol information from INSAT-3DR imager data is a 3-step process:\n1) Cloud masking\n2) Composite the visible images to estimate the surface reflectance, and\n3) Use the surface reflectance with an image to retrieve the aerosol optical depth.\nThese steps are described below.\nCloud Masking of INSAT-3DR Imager data\nClouds are generally characterized by higher reflectance and lower temperature than the\nunderlying earth surface. As such, simple visible and infrared window threshold\napproaches offer considerable skill in cloud detection. Following threshold-based tests\nwill be performed to detect the cloudy pixels.\na) Visible band threshold test\nThe reflectance threshold test using visible band of INSTA-3D/3DR. Pixels with visible\nchannel reflectance greater than 0.3 over land and greater than 0.10 over ocean are\nconsidered cloudy.\nb) TIR Brightness temperature threshold test\nAerosol\nPixels with brightness temperature in TIR1 channel less than 273 are considered cloudy.\nc) Standard deviation threshold test\nLand: 3X3 pixel window is considered for calculating standard deviation in visible and\nTIR1 channel. If standard deviation of visible channel and TIR1 BT is greater than 0.03\nand 4, respectively than all pixels in 3X3 window are masked.\nOcean: 3X3 pixel window is considered for calculating standard deviation in visible and\nTIR1 channel. If standard deviation of visible channel and TIR1 BT is greater than 0.015\nand 1, respectively, than all pixels in 3X3 window are masked.\nSurface Reflectance Retrieval\nEstimating the surface contribution to the TOA INSAT-3D/3DR Imager visible\nreflectance is difficult since observations will have atmospheric contamination. For\ninstance, a visible observation from INSAT-3DR Imager on a cloudless day with low\naerosol burden will still have gaseous absorption (primarily, ozone and water vapour);\nRayleigh scattering; and residual aerosol extinction. This atmospheric component to the\nTOA reflectance needs to be removed to retrieve the surface reflectance. While studies\nhave shown it is possible to estimate the surface component from observations in the near\ninfrared (e.g. 2.1 ¬µm) where aerosol and Rayleigh scattering are very low (Kaufman et al.\n2002), the INSAT-3D/3DR imager lacks an observation at this wavelength. Therefore, a\ncompositing method will be used to estimate the surface reflectance.\nThe INSAT-3D/3DR visible channel radiance is converted to top of the atmosphere\n(TOA) reflectance. TOA reflectance is then corrected for ozone and water Vapor\nabsorption. Water vapour and ozone concentration are used from NCEP model data.\nFurther Rayleigh reflectance is removed from the gaseous absorption corrected TOA\nreflectance to get Rayleigh corrected reflectance. This reflectance has aerosol and surface\ncontribution only. Now for each pixel, the 30 day previous Rayleigh corrected reflectance\nis sorted and first and second minima is computed. First minima represent the clearest\ncondition, however, due to cloud shadow contamination, sometimes first minima may not\nbe the true representative of surface reflectance, therefore to remove shadow effect, and\nwe put a threshold test on first minima. If first minima are less than 0.04 then second\nminima will be considered otherwise first minima is considered. The threshold of 0.04 on\nfirst minimum to avoid shadow effect is empirical. This sorting of Rayleigh corrected\nreflectance and selection of first or second minima is done for all pixel to obtain clear\ncomposite image. By using this value to obtain the surface reflectance, one assumes that\naerosol would increase the reflectance and cloud shadows will be rare. The length of the\ntime is somewhat subjective. In general, a long enough time is needed for at least one\ncloud-free observation. Knapp et al. (2005) used a two week (i.e., 14 day) period. The\nclear composite reflectance is then corrected for background aerosol optical depth (0.02\nand 0.04 for ocean and land respectively) to estimate Lambertian surface reflectance\n(œÅ ). The image in figure (1) shows Lambartian surface reflectance computed using\nsurf\nabove mentioned method from INSAT-3D data from 4-31 December, 2013 and 4-31\nJanuary 2014 which is used for aerosol inversion on 1 January 2014 and 1 February 2014,\nrespectively.\nAerosol\nFigure 1. Shows Lambartian surface reflectance derived from clear composite method\nusing INSAT-3D visible channel data (a) derived from data for the period of 4-31\nDecember 2013. (b) Derived from data for the period of 4-31 January 2013.\nThe accuracy of the composite depends on the length of time used to create it. For\ninstance, enough cloud-free observations must exist with little aerosol influence for the\nsurface reflectance to be accurate. Areas of persistent aerosol or cloud cover will be\nlikely to have caused errors in the retrieved surface reflectance because the atmospheric\ncomponent remains large in such situations. It is to be noted that in previous version of\nAOD retrieval algorithm (version1 an d 2), instead of minimizing Rayleigh corrected\nreflectance, the TOA radiance was minimized, therefore the effect of change in solar\nzenith angle during the period of previous 30 days decreases the accuracy of derived\nsurface reflectance.\nAerosol Optical Depth Retrieval\nThe aerosol optical depth retrieval is performed using an INSAT-3D/3DR imager visible\nimage and the retrieved surface reflectance (from the previous step). In this retrieval, the\ncurrent day TOA reflectance is corrected for ozone and water vapour absorption and also\ncorrected for Rayleigh reflectance. Then precomputed look tables (using 6S radiative\ntransfer model) that consist spherical albedo, reflectance, transmittance as a function of\nsun-sensor geometry and aerosol optical thickness are used to simulate theoretical\nRayleigh corrected reflectance which is then compared with observed Rayleigh corrected\nINSAT-3DR reflectance to obtained aerosol optical depth. It is to noted that over land\ncontinental aerosol model is used while over ocean maritime aerosol model is used. In\nprevious versions of AOD retrival algorithm, single scattering approximation was used\nfor inverting AOD, assuming perfectly scattering aerosol (single scattering albedo\nassumed to be unity). Figure 2 shows the schematic flow chart of the aerosol optical\nthickness (AOD) retrieval procedure.\nAerosol\n10.4.1.2 Flow Chart\n10.4.2 Operational Implementation\nStep 1: Conversion from gray count to visible radiance and TIR brightness temperature.\nStep 2: Cloud Masking.\nStep 3: Conversion of TOA radiance to TOA reflectance.\nStep 4: Correction of TOA reflectance for gaseous absorption and Rayleigh scattering.\nStep 5: Generation of clear composite image using darkest observation using last 28-days\ndata.\nStep 6: Atmospheric correction of clear composite image for background aerosol and\ngeneration of Lambartian surface reflectance.\nStep 7: Correct current day visible data for gaseous absorption and molecular scattering.\nStep 8: Invert current day Rayleigh corrected reflectance to get AOD using Lambartian\nsurface reflectance and pre-computed LUTs.\nAerosol\n10.5 Outputs\nParameter Unit Min Max Accuracy Resolution\nAerosol Dimensionless 0 5 15-20% 10 Km\noptical\ndepth at 550\nnm\n10.5.1 format of the output and the domain\nLat , Lon, AOD ,\nDomain :\n40 to 40 N, 30 E to 120 E\n10.6 Validation\n10.6.1 Data required\nPrameter Resolution Source\nAERONET spectral In-situ point AERONET sites in India Kanpur,\nAOD data observation Gandhi college (Patna) and Jaipur\nSpectral AOD using In-situ point Data collection campaigns will be\nhandheld sun-photometer observation organized\nMODIS AOD products 0.1 to 1 degree Data available through internet\n10.6.2 Methods of validation\nAERONET data for Validation\nPost-launch routine ground-based observations can be made using AERONET, and any\nof the several miscellaneous techniques, including the diffuse/direct method, aureole\nmeters, and polarization measurements. AeRoNet (Aerosol Robotic Network) is a\nnetwork of ground-based sun-photometers established and maintained by Brent Holben\nof Code 923 of the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and Tom Eck of Raytheon ITSS.\nThe sun-photometers measure the spectral aerosol optical thickness and sky radiance. In\nIndia 3 Aeronet sites namely Kanpur, Goa and Dharwar are providing systematic in-situ\nAOD measurements. Data from these sites will be used for validation of INSAT-\n3D/3DR derived AODs.\nPost-Launch Special Field Experiments\nMany of the present satellite observations are augmented by special field campaigns to\nprovide ground-truth data for the satellite-derived measurements. The INSAT-3D/3DR\nImager derived aerosol optical thickness measurements will be validated using hand-held\nsun-photometer. The details of these campaigns (timing, location, instrumentation, etc.)\nwill be decided later on.\nAerosol\nPost-Launch Satellite-Based Inter-comparisons\nINSAT-3D/3DR Imager derived aerosol optical depths may be validated by comparing\nthem with aerosol optical depths derived by other satellite sensors, such as MODIS. The\nbasic inter-comparison technique involves three steps: 1) identification of locations where\nboth sensors fly over at nearly the same time; 2) extraction of data for storage in an inter-\ncomparison archive; 3) analysis of the differences between the measurements.\n10.7 Technical issues (Limitation etc.)\nAccuracy of the product depends on the accuracy of the radiation model to simulate the\nsatellite radiances. However, the following limitations of the present study have to be\nkept in mind.\n(i) Characterization of surface reflectivity is critical of the study. Use of darkest\nobservation for last 28 days provides mean reflectivity. This may also introduce\nsignificant errors in derived AOD, specially for the location with persistent AOD for long\nperiod.\n(ii) Due to single visible channel aerosol type is to be fixed which is in reality is not a\ngood approximation. This may introduce large errors in retrieved AOD.\n(iii) Over bright surface and high aerosol loadings, TOA reflectance becomes insensitive\nto aerosol therefore; AOD over bright surfaces may have large uncertainty.\n10.8 Future Scope\nIn future algorithms making use of INSAT-3D/3DR imager data for SWIR and MIR\nbands can also be attempted for characterization of surface reflectivity.\n10.9 References\n1.

The sensor transmits signals at regular interval and receives energy back\nscattered by the targets on the Earth. The DPGS generates Level 1B product from the\nsensor data. The Level 1B product carries back scattering coefficient (or sigma0) and\nother radiometric parameters along with geolocation information. The Level 4 products\nare generated from Level 1B products.\nThis document describes format of Level 4 products of SCATSAT1 (operational version\n1.0). These are high resolution products and are generated using Scatterometer Image\nReconstruction (or SIR) technique.\nCurrently, three parameters are given as a product: sigma0, gamma0 and brightness\ntemperature. Depending on geo location extent, various categories of a product are\ndefined. Depending on combinations of polarization/pass/look and temporal extent of\ndata, various sub-categories of Level 4 products are defined. For a product (say, of\nsigma0, gamma0 or brightness temperature), the categories are described in Table 1\nbelow:\nTable 1 Categories of Level 4 Products\nSpatial Extent\nCategory Sub-category\nLat.

The product\nformat is GeoTIFF. The India Products and Global Products are defined in geographic\nlat-lon grid. The Polar products are defined in Polar Projection as specified by NPs.mpp\nand SPs.mpp of NSIDC (National Snow and Ice Data Centre) maps library. The EPSG\ncodes for North and South polar projection defined by NPs.mpp and SPs.mpp are 3411\nand 3412 respectively. The spatial resolution of INDIA products for all parameters is\n0.02¬∞.

The brief introduction of the\nformat is presented in section 2.1. Relevant information about Level 4 product is placed\nin next sub section.\n2.1 Details of GeoTIFF:\nRemote sensing and its applications use data in digital form. These datasets generally\ncontain digital image along with other information which are further used for data\ninterpretation and other applications. Different communities use these data for their\nrequired purpose. To make it convenient to the users, standards are required to store these\ndatasets. Many image file formats like GIF, PGM, BMP, JPEG etc. are available\nglobally. These formats have an image header with fixed fields containing information\nsuch as image dimensions, color space specification, etc.\nHowever, these formats have no facility to store information related to geo-location of\nimage pixels. They also do not support storage of cartographic data. Due to these\nlimitations, a new format is required to store image data along with image geometry as\nwell as cartographic information along with ancillary information required for further\nprocessing. The new format has to be platform independent, flexible and extensible. The\nTagged Image File Format (TIFF) is one of the popularly available image formats. It is\nplatform independent extensible. Several third party solutions exist for recording\n2\ncartographic information using TIFF tags. The specifications for these tags (fields) are\navailable in TIFF-6.0 documents. These fields contain information ranging from the most\nprimary, like image dimensions, over the most sophisticated information like copyright,\nup to so-called 'private tags' or 'custom tags' that can define to hold application-specific\ninformation. The TIFF specification defines a framework for an image header called\n'IFD' (Image File Directory) that is essentially a flexible set of specifically those tags that\nthe TIFF writer software wishes to specify.\nThe TIFF file format can be used to store and digital satellite image data, scanned aerial\nphotos, elevation models, scanned maps and the results of many types of geographic\nanalysis. TIFF is the only full-featured format in the public domain, capable of\nsupporting extension to include geographic metadata. GeoTIFF implements the\ngeographic metadata formally, using compliant TIFF tags and structures. A GeoTIFF file\nactually contains geographic (or cartographic) data attached as tags within the TIFF file.\nThe geographic data can then be used to position the image in the correct location and\ngeometry on the screen of a geographic information display. GeoTIFF is a metadata\nformat, which provides geographic information to associate with the image data. But the\nTIFF file structure allows both the metadata and the image data to be encoded into the\nsame file. GeoTIFF makes use of a public tag structure which is platform interoperable\nbetween any and all GeoTIFF- readers.\nThe GeoTIFF format is supported by TIFF ‚Äì 6.0. That is, the GeoTIFF images conform\nin every way to the TIFF formal specifications. The tags used for the \"Geo\" portion of\nthe TIFF format conform to the acceptable and customary use of \"private\" or \"registered\"\nTIFF tags. The GeoTIFF tags and definitions are considered completely to the baseline\nand extended TIFF tag definitions currently supported in TIFF-6 by Aldus Corp.\n2.2 Details of Level 4 products:\nA set of geographic parameters required to interpret the product for each category has\nbeen defined. This set is used for placing geographic information in GeoTIFF in form of\ntags (or keys). The sets for various categories of products are shown in Table 4 below:\nTable 4 (a) Parameters of INDIA and GLOBAL products\nParamter Value for Value for Value for\nINDIA GLOBAL 0.02¬∞ GLOBAL 0.0625¬∞\nOutputLineSpacing 0.02 0.02 0.0625\nOutputPixelSpacing 0.02 0.02 0.0625\nNoScans 1700 9000 2880\nNoPixels 1800 18000 5760\nULLat 39.99 89.99 89.968750\nULLon 64.01 -179.99 -179.968750\nURLat 39.99 89.99 89.968750\n3\nURLon 99.99 179.99 179.968750\nLRLat 6.01 -89.99 -89.968750\nLRLon 99.99 179.99 179.968750\nLLLat 6.01 -89.99 -89.968750\nLLLon 64.01 -179.99 -179.968750\nSceneCenterLat 23.00 0.00 0.00\nSceneCenterLon 82.00 180.00 180.00\nEllipsoidSemiMajorAxis 6378137.0 6378137.0 6378137.0\nEllipsoidSemiMinorAxis 6356752.3139897 6356752.3139897 6356752.3139897\nTable 4 (b) Parameters of POLAR products\nParameter Value for NORTH POLAR Value for SOUTH POLAR\nOutputLineSpacing 2216.453682 2257.350185\nOutputPixelSpacing 2216.453682 2257.350185\nNoScans 3001 4001\nNoPixels 3001 4001\nMapOriginLat 90.0 -90.0\nMapOriginLon -45.0 0.0\nULLat 48.457512 -35.429245\nULLon 179.999710 -44.989052\nURLat 48.457512 -35.429245\nURLon 90.002022 45.010746\nLRLat 48.457512 -35.429245\nLRLon 0.001852 135.010422\nLLLat 48.457512 -35.429245\nLLLon -89.998314 -134.989563\nULMapX -3323679.50 -4514076.50\nULMapY 3323713.25 4515802.00\nURMapX 3323579.00 4515786.00\nURMapY 3323813.50 4514092.50\nLRMapX 3323803.75 4514118.00\nLRMapY -3323589.00 -4515760.50\nLLMapX -3323598.50 -4515761.50\nLLMapY -3323794.25 -4514117.00\nSceneCenterLat 90.0 -90.0\nSceneCenterLon -45.0 0.0\nStandardParallel1 70.0 -70.0\nFalseEasting 0.0 0.0\nFalseNorthing 0.0 0.0\nEllipsoidSemiMajorAxis 6378273.0 6378273.0\nEllipsoidSemiMinorAxis 6356889.4489106 6356889.4489106\nEllipsoidEccentricity 0.081816153 0.081816153\nThe corner lat-lon and mapx-mapy values define in GeoTIFF refers to the value of centre\nof the corner pixel.\n4\nThe data part of the product carries the parameter values in range defined by minimum\nand maximum defined in Table 5 below. Any value out of this range is clipped (to lower\nor upper bound of range) appropriately. The image pixels are coded as unsigned short\ninteger using slope and offset. The slope and offset are mentioned in the corresponding\nxml file. The BT value can be obtained from unsigned short integer value as shown by\nequation 1. The sigma0 or gamma0 value can be obtained from unsigned integer value as\nshown by equations 2 to 7. Basically, LSB of sigma0 or gamma0 product carries the sign\nof parameter in linear scale. Rest of the bits carry sigma0/gamma0 value in dB.\nFor BT:\nBT_value_in_degK = unsigned_short_int_value*slope + offset (1)\nFor sigma0 and gamma0:\nintermediate_value = unsigned_short_int_value AND (0xFFFE) (2)\nsign_bit = unsigned_short_int_value AND (0x0001) (3)\npara_value_in_dB = intermediate_value*slope + offset (4)\nsign_value = -1 if sign_bit = 1 (5)\nsign_value = 1 if sign_bit = 0 (6)\npara_value_in_linear_scale = sign_value*10.0^(para_value_in_dB/10.0) (7)\nThe absence of parameter is denoted by coded value of 65535. So, value of parameter\nshould be computed only if coded value is not equal to 65535.\nTable 5 Slope and Offset for products\nProduct Parameter Slope Offset Minimum Maximum Physical unit\nSigma0 0.001 -50.0 -50.0 15.0 dB\nBrightness Temperature 0.01 0.0 0.0 640.0 deg.

SARAL is an acronym for\n\"SAtellite for ARgos and ALtiKa\" with two payloads namely AltiKa, a Ka-band (35-GHz) radar\naltimeter and ARGOS, a data collection platform for a variety of physical and biological data\nfrom ocean in-situ instruments like Ocean buoys etc. SARAL realizes ocean radar altimetry\nthrough a suite of altimetry payloads which includes the DORIS and LRA instruments for\nprecise orbit determination (POD); a dual-frequency microwave radiometer (MWR) at\n24/37GHz for water vapor correction. At 35 GHz, not only is the ionospheric contamination of\nthe pulse echo negligible, it also gives a better vertical resolution of about 0.3m for wave\nestimation and a compact, light-weight instrument for greater portability.\nThe objectives of AltiKa mission are: To realize precise, repetitive global measurements of sea\nsurface for studying mesoscale variability, developing coastal oceanography, inland waters and\nice sheets monitoring and understanding of climate change.\nThis document is User Handbook for the ‚ÄúMoving closer to the coast by SARAL/AltiKa:\nGeophysical Product for Indian Mainland Region‚Äù. This product was conceived in the\nframework of deriving high resolution ‚ÄúCoastal Product‚Äù project under SARAL/AltiKa mission.\nThis coastal product is an experimental product derived from SARAL/AltiKa S-IGDR tracks.\nThe document provides an insight to coastal product and various algorithms used in its\nderivation. It is advised that user refer the SARAL/AltiKa product handbook (SARAL/AltiKa User\nHandbook, Dec, 2013), as present document is an add-on with specific retrackers and quality flags\nfor 40-Hz data processing.\nFigure 1. Different tracks of SARAL AltiKa (in white) near Indian coast used in the study.\nTracks are overlaid on ocean bathymetry. Along-track coastal 40-Hz products are derived up to\n50 km from the coast.\n1\n1.1 Overview of the product\nIn Open Ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge\nfollowed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in\nagreement with the theoretical Brown model (Brown 1977) and hence can be easily modeled.\nOutput of the Brown model is sea surface height (SSH), significant wave height (SWH) and\nbackscatter coefficient (Sigma (0)). Sea surface height anomaly (SSHA) is further computed\nfrom SSH. The waveforms measured in the coastal area do not conform to the theoretical Brown\nmodel due to land contamination and inaccurate geophysical corrections. Special data\nprocessing efforts are needed for coastal region. SARAL/AltiKa coastal product is concerned\nwith providing the geo-physical parameters SSHA, SSH, SWH and Wind Speed from the\nretracking algorithms BETA5, BETA9 and BAGP at 40-Hz data rate. The distance between the\nconsecutive points in the 40-Hz data is approximately 180 meters. Geophysical products have\nbeen computed along the tracks of SARAL/AltiKa in the coastal regions of Indian Mainland.\nThe tracks are shown in Fig. 1 in white. List of tracks are provided (in ascending order) here:\n0010, 0023, 0038, 0051, 0066, 0081, 0096, 0109, 0124, 0137, 0152,\n0182, 0195, 0210, 0223, 0238, 0281, 0296, 0309, 0324, 0367, 0382,\n0395, 0410, 0423, 0453, 0468, 0481, 0496, 0509, 0524, 0539, 0554,\n0567, 0582, 0595, 0610, 0640, 0653, 0668, 0681, 0696, 0726, 0739,\n0754, 0767, 0782, 0825, 0840, 0853, 0868, 0911, 0926, 0939, 0954,\n0967, 0997\nUsers can use links in http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/tools/pass-locator.html to locate the\nSARAL/AltiKa tracks. Users can refer SARAL/AltiKa User Handbook (Dec, 2013) for more information\nabout the tracks.\nApart from SSH, SSHA, SWH and wind speed some other useful parameters in the coastal\nparameters which are useful for users are also provided. These are listed below:\n1) Backscatter Coefficient (Sigma (0)) from different retracking algorithms\n2) Quality parameters of the retracker and retracking flag\n3) Waveform shape classification\n4) Distance from the coast and land flag\n5) Interpolated corrections\n6) Ocean retracker is also provided from standard S-IGDR product.\nThis product is experimental and similar in approach to the PISTACH product (Refer PISTACH\nUser Handbook, Oct, 2010) for Jason-2 altimeter.\n2\n2. Domain and data format\nThe domain of the coastal product is for the Indian mainland coastal region (~50 km from the\ncoast) as shown in Fig. 1. Maximum and minimum latitude and longitude are given below.\ngeospatial_lat_min = 05N\ngeospatial_lat_max = 24N\ngeospatial_lon_min = 68E\ngeospatial_lon_max = 90E\nThe output is provided in the NETCDF file format.

Processing involved in the coastal product and parameters provided\nPrior to describing, the processing involved in deriving coastal products, it will be useful to\nunderstand the procedure involved in the computation of geo physical parameters from altimeter\nin the open ocean. In the following sections we first discuss the open ocean altimeter data\nprocessing.\n3.1 Altimeter Data Processing for Open Ocean\nBasic measurement of an altimeter is in form of a time series known as waveform in which\npower is distributed along various measuring gates of an altimeter as depicted in Figure 2. These\ngates arise due to signal processing and decide the vertical resolution of the altimeter. A model is\nfitted to the altimeter waveform, and the model parameters provide the geophysical parameters\nor their corrections. Fitted model is shown as blue curve in the same Figure. This process of\nmodeling the altimetric waveform is known as retracking and the specific model used for\nretracking is known as a retracker. A theoretical model (known as MLE4 retracker), based on\nthe scattering of a radar pulse from the sea-surface, was formulated by Brown (1977) and is\nextensively used for open ocean waveform retracking.\n3\nFigure 2. A typical open ocean waveform from SARAL/AltiKa (red) and fitted waveform by the\nMLE4 retracker in blue\nTo the first order, this model is given as by Amarouche et al.

Note that thermal noise is\nalso present in the actual altimetric waveforms.\nFigure 3. Brown model and the related retrieved parameters.\nFitting the waveform model with the altimetric waveform is done using the Maximum\nLikelihood Estimator (MLE) technique explained in Amarouche et al. (2004). After fitting the\ntheoretical model to the altimetric waveform three basic parameters are computed as described in\nthe following sub-sections.\n5\n3.1.1 Computation of Sea Surface Height Anomaly\nParameter ùë° computed from equation 3.1 gives retracking correction to the range calculated by\n0\nthe onboard tracker on the satellite. The range is also corrected for the geophysical and the\ninstrument corrections.\nCorrected Altimeter Range = Tracker Range + ùíï + geophysical corrections + instrument\nùüé\ncorrections.\nAltimeter range is then subtracted from the Altitude of satellite to give the SSH. Geophysical\ncorrections in the altimeter will be discussed in the Section 5.\nSSH = Altitude - Corrected Altimeter Range\nSea Surface Height Anomaly (SSHA) is then calculated by subtracting Mean Sea Surface (MSS).\nMSS is the long term mean of the Sea Surface Height calculated by averaging the SSH by the\nprevious satellite altimeters.\nSSHA = SSH - MSS\n3.1.2 Computation of Significant Wave Height\nùúé from equation 3.1 is the composite rise time of the waveform. This parameter is obtained by\nùëê\nfitting the waveform with the theoretical model. Antenna characteristic ùúé is already known. So\nùëù\nwe can compute ùúé which is root mean square (RMS) surface elevation.\nùë†\n( 2 œÉ )2 = œÉ2 - œÉ2\ns c p\nc\nwhere c is speed of light\nSWH is approximated as four times the RMS elevation ùúé .\nùë†\nùëÜùëäùêª = 4ùúé\nùë†\n6\n3.1.3 Computation of Wind Speed\nWind speed is obtained generally using empirical relationships based on backscatter coefficient\nùúé which is obtained by the ‚Ä≤ùê¥‚Ä≤ term in the equation 3.1 as follows\n0\nùùà (ùíÖùë©) = ùüèùüéùê•ùê®ùê†(ùë®)+ùíîùíÑùíÇùíçùíäùíèùíà ùíáùíÇùíÑùíïùíêùíì+ùíÇùíïùíéùíêùíîùíëùíÜùíâùíÜùíìùíäùíÑ ùíÑùíêùíìùíìùíÜùíÑùíïùíäùíêùíè\nùüé\n+ùíäùíèùíîùíïùíìùíñùíéùíÜùíèùíï ùíÑùíêùíìùíìùíÜùíÑùíïùíäùíêùíèùíî\nScaling factor accounts for all the parameters of the radar equation except the amplitude of the\nwaveform. ùúé is also accounted for the atmospheric correction due to propagation in medium\n0\nand the instrument corrections.\nThe wind speed is calculated in S-IGDR by using one dimensional model given by Lillibridge et\nal. (2014) which is a function of backscatter coefficient. Equations for calculating wind speed\nusing one dimensional model are shown below\nùõº‚àíùõΩùúé ùëñùëì ùúé ‚â§ ùúé\n0 0 ùëè\nùëà = { (3.2)\nùëö ùõæùëíùë•ùëù(‚àíùõøùúé ) ùëñùëì ùúé > ùúé\n0 0 ùëè\nwhere ùõº = 34.2, ùõΩ = 2.48, ùõæ = 720, ùõø = 0.42 and ùúé = 11.4\nùëè\nWind speed = ùëà +1.4 ùëà 0.096 ùëíùë•ùëù (‚àí0.32ùëà 1.096)\nùëö ùëö ùëö\nOne dimensional model from eqn. (3.2) is used for calculating wind speed from backscatter\ncoefficient obtained from all the retracking algorithms.\nNote: In general, the geophysical parameters are calculated at 40-Hz and then averaged\nover 1-Hz by using some filtering procedure. But in coastal regions 1-Hz resolution which\nis approx. 7 km, is not very useful to provide the resolution needed for most of the coastal\napplications. 40-Hz data can be noisy due to limited averaging. Therefore, 40-Hz data can\nbe used for research purposes in coastal regions. It is suggested that the 40-Hz data should\nbe filtered and averaged according to the specific applications.\nGeophysical parameters computed from the Ocean retracker as provided in the S-IGDR product\nare also provided. The list of these parameters is given below:\nSSHA :: ssha_mle4_40hz\n7\nSSH :: ssh_mle4_40hz\nSWH :: swh_mle4_40hz\nWIND SPEED :: wind_speed_mle4_40hz\n3.2 Retracking algorithms used in the coastal product\nAlthough eqn. 3.1 (ocean model) works well in the Open Ocean, in the coastal areas this\nmodel fails due to incursion of the land in the footprint of the altimeter as shown in Figure 4. In\norder to encounter this contamination, specific retracking algorithms are used in the coastal\nregions.\nFigure 4. Sample waveform in the Coastal Ocean from SARAL/AltiKa (red) and fitted with the\nOpen Ocean model (blue).\nIn coastal product we have provided three types of retrackers which are useful for the retrieval of\nparameters in the coastal region. These retrackers are discussed in the following sections.\n3.2.1 Beta retracker with exponential edge\nMartin et al. (1983) developed a retracking algorithm for processing altimeter waveforms over\ncontinental ice sheets. This algorithm was used to retrack all SEASAT radar altimeter\nwaveforms. This retracker was found useful in many coastal studies eg. Deng (2003)\n8\nThe algorithm fits a 5 or 9-parameter function to the altimeter waveform. The first function is for\nfitting returns with single ramp in the trailing edge while the second one is used to fit returns\nwith double ramps in the trailing edge. Single-ramp returns are modeled by 5-parameter model\n(Figure 5). The functional form for which is given in the equation below:\nW(t) = Œ≤ +Œ≤ (1+Œ≤ Q)P(\nt-Œ≤3)\n(3.3)\n1 2 5\nŒ≤4\nwhere\n0 for t < Œ≤ +0.5Œ≤\nQ = { 3 4 (3.4)\nt - (Œ≤ +0.5Œ≤ ) for t > Œ≤ +0.5Œ≤\n3 4 3 4\nùë• 1 ‚àíùëû2\nùëÉ(ùë•) = ‚à´ ùëíùë•ùëù( )ùëëùëû (3.5)\n‚àí‚àû‚àö2ùúã 2\nThe unknown parameters related to a waveform are:\n1) Œ≤ : Thermal noise level of waveform\n1\n2) Œ≤ : Return signal amplitude\n2\n3) Œ≤ : Midpoint on the leading edge of the waveform\n3\n4) Œ≤ : Return waveform rise-time\n4\n5) Œ≤ : Slope of the trailing edge\n5\nŒ≤ (the rise-time) is equivalent to ùúé , the composite rise-time. The formula used to derive the\n4 ùëê\nSWH from the rise time is:\nœÉ2 = œÉ2 +( 2 œÉ )2\nc p s\nc\nwhere c is speed of light (3.6)\nùëÜùëäùêª = 4ùúé\nùë†\n9\nFigure 5. Cartoon showing different parameters in the 5 parameter BETA retracker.\nIn eqn. (3.6), ùúé is written instead of Œ≤ to denote the composite rise-time. Please note that ùúé\nùëê 4 ùëê\nis composite rise time and is slightly different from ùúé which is RMS of surface elevation.\nùë†\nSimple form of eqn. 3.3 helps in encountering the contamination in the waveforms.\n9 parameter form of eqn.

Cartoon showing different parameters in the 9 parameter BETA retracker.\nDeng and Featherstone (2006) gave a different expression than eq. (3.2) with exponential trailing\nedge for 5 parameters which is given as\nW(t) = Œ≤ +Œ≤ exp(-Œ≤ Q)P(\nt-Œ≤3)\n(3.9)\n1 2 5\nŒ≤4\nwhere ùëÉ is same as in eqn. 3.4 and\n0 for t < Œ≤ -2Œ≤\nQ = { 3 4 (3.10)\nt - (Œ≤ +0.5Œ≤ ) for t > Œ≤ -2Œ≤\n3 4 3 4\n9 parameter form of eqn. (3.9) is given as\nW(t) = Œ≤ Œ≤ exp(-Œ≤ Q )P(\nt-Œ≤3\n)(t)+Œ≤ exp(-Œ≤ Q )P(\nt-Œ≤7\n) (3.11)\n1+ 2 5 1 6 9 2\nŒ≤4 Œ≤8\nwhere ùëÉ is same as in eqn. 3.5 and\n11\nùëÑ and ùëÑ are analogous to eqn. 3.10 as\n1 2\n0 for t < Œ≤ ‚àí2Œ≤\nQ = { 3 4 (3.12)\n1 t ‚àí (Œ≤ +0.5Œ≤ ) for t > Œ≤ ‚àí2Œ≤\n3 4 3 4\n0 for t < Œ≤ ‚àí2Œ≤\nQ = { 7 8\n2 t ‚àí (Œ≤ +0.5Œ≤ ) for t > Œ≤ ‚àí2Œ≤\n7 8 7 8\nBoth BETA5 (Equation 3.7) and BETA9 (Equation 3.11) have been used to generate coastal\nproducts. Reasons for specifically using BETA5 and BETA9 retarckers is because\nSARAL/AltiKa has very low mispointing angle which gives an exponential form to trailing edge\nof the waveform. So the linear trailing edge is not an appropriate choice for retracking. The\nmethod used for fitting model to the waveform is an iterative non-linear fitting approach, which\nis the least squares method with appropriate weighing scheme (Deng, 2003).\nGeophysical parameters derived from the BETA retrackers are provided in the coastal product as\nper the following naming convention:\nFor 5 parameter BETA retracker\nSSHA :: ssha_beta5_40hz\nSSH :: ssh_beta5_40hz\nSWH :: swh_beta5_40hz\nWIND SPEED :: wind_speed_beta5_40hz\nSimilarly, for 9 parameter BETA retracker\nSSHA :: ssha_beta9_40hz\nSSH :: ssh_beta9_40hz\nSWH :: swh_beta9_40hz\nWIND SPEED :: wind_speed_beta9_40hz\n12\n3.2.2 Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak model (BAGP)\nThis model adds the asymmetric Gaussian peak with the ocean type waveform in order to model\nthe waveforms in the coastal region. Halimi et al. (2013) gave a Brown + peak model and\nimplemented it by using MLE and Nelder-Mead unconstrained optimization method. The\nfunctional form of the model is given as:\nùëä(ùë°) = ùëä (ùë°)+ ùëÉ (ùë°) (3.11)\nùëè ùëò\nWhere W (ùë°) is same as eq. 3.1 and the peak component P (ùë°) is given as\nb k\nùëÉ (ùë°) = ùê¥ ùëíùë•ùëù [ ‚àí1 (ùë°‚àíùëá )2]{ùõæ[ (ùë°‚àíùëá ùëò ) ] } (3.12)\nùëò ùëò 2ùúé2 ùëò ‚àö2\nùëò\nùê¥ , ùëá , ùúé , and ùõæ are amplitude, position, width and asymmetry coefficient of the peak\nùëò ùëò ùëò\nrespectively.\nTwo type of fitting methods for this algorithm, following Halimi et al. (2013), are provided. One\nfitting is done by the least square method while the other is using Nelder Mead (Nelder et al,\n1965) method of fitting. The latter will be referred to as BAGP (nm).\nThe geophysical parameters are provided as variables in the product as:\nSSHA :: ssha_bagp_40hz/ ssha_bagp_nm_40hz\nSSH :: ssh_bagp_40hz/ ssh_bagp_nm_40hz\nSWH :: swh_bagp_40hz/ swh_bagp_nm_40hz\nWIND SPEED :: wind_speed_bagp_40hz/ wind_speed_bagp_nm_40hz\n3.3 Other related parameters\nThese are some other parameters (not exactly geophysical products) related to retrackers that are\nimportant for inclusion in the product. They are described in the following sub-sections.\n13\n3.3.1 Backscatter Coefficient\nBackscatter coefficient (Sigma(0)) is an important parameter for wind speed computation. This\nvariable is computed from each of the retrackers and are named as follows:\nsigma_zero_mle4_40hz for MLE4 retracker\nsigma_zero _beta5_40hz for 5 parameter BETA retracker\nsigma_zero _beta9_40hz for 9 parameter BETA retracker\nsigma_zero _bagp_40hz for BAGP retracker\nsigma_zero _bagp_nm_40hz for BAGP (nm) retracker\n3.3.2 Quality flags for retrackers.\nThe retracking quality flags are provided in the coastal product in the following manner:\nflag_mle4_40hz for MLE4 retracker\nflag_beta5_40hz for 5 parameter BETA retracker\nflag_beta9_40hz for 9 parameter BETA retracker\nflag_bagp_40hz for BAGP retracker\nflag_bagp_nm_40hz for BAGP (nm) retracker\nThis is a simple flag. Its value is zero if retracking has been performed.\nNote: Users must note that sometimes the retracking is successful but the fitted waveforms\nstill do not fit the original waveforms. Therefore, an additional fitting quality parameter,\nmean quadratic error (MQE) is also provided. This parameter gives an idea about the\nerrors in fitting from various algorithms.\nMQE is mean squared difference between the observed waveforms and the fitted model.\nWaveform and model waveform power are normalized by the maximum power in waveforms.\nùëÄùëÑùê∏ = 1 ‚àë (ùë§ùëéùë£ùëíùëìùëúùëüùëö(ùëñ)‚àíùëöùëúùëëùëíùëô(ùëñ))2 (3.13)\nùëñ=1:ùëÅ\nùëÅ\nN=128 for SARAL\n14\nLesser the MQE better the retracking result. MQE also depends on the noise content in\nwaveforms and therefore relative MQE and the flags have to be checked before using the\ngeophysical parameter.\nmqe_mle4_40hz for MLE4 retracker\nmqe_beta5_40hz for 5 parameter BETA retracker\nmqe_beta9_40hz for 9 parameter BETA retracker\nmqe_bagp_40hz for BAGP retracker\nmqe_bagp_nm_40hz for BAGP (nm) retracker\nNote: It is suggested that the both retracking flags as well as MQE should be checked\nbefore using the geophysical parameters from any retracker. Users can set a threshold for\nMQE for using the data.\nThere is no rain flag in the SARAL data but an additional trailing_edge_variation_flag_40hz\nparameter is provided in the IGDR product. This flag accounts for the rain as well as presence of\ndense cloud as SARAL/AltiKa is more sensitive to water vapor than Ku-C dual frequency\naltimeters. Same flag has been provided in the product.\n4. Shape Classification of altimetric waveforms\nDifferent type of shapes of waveforms other than the standard deep ocean type (Brown type)\nwaveforms are usually encountered in the coastal areas. The algorithms discussed in the Section\n3.2 were based on modeling the shapes of the coastal waveforms, so it becomes necessary to\nclassify the waveform based on predefined shape. In coastal product a linear discriminant\nanalysis (LDA) based technique was used to classify the waveforms on the basis of their shapes.\nAs shown in the Figure 7 there are different types of shape in which waveforms are classified.\nExplanation of these classes is given as follows:\nClass 1: Brown type waveforms; which are characteristic for deep ocean and follows Brown\nmodel.\n15\nClass 2: Peak echoes; which are received due to high reflectance either due to still water\npresence or due to high reflection from land.\nClass 3: Very noisy type echoes; having a lot of noise and no shape feature is identified.\nClass 4: Peak at the end of echoes; found near land.\nClass 5: Brown + peaky echoes; these type along with class7 are received when both ocean and\nland exist in the footprint of altimeter. It is a mixed type of signal.\nClass 6: Linear; found near land or due to on-board tracker errors\nClass 7: Brown + peak on the trailing edge; described in class 5.\nClass 8: Peaky + Noise echoes; formed due to high reflectance from land in the footprint of\naltimeter.\nFigure 7. Different classes of waveforms\nClassification involves three steps:\n1) Feature selection\n2) Dimensionality reduction by LDA\n3) Class assignment by Bayesian classifier\n16\nMore details are provided in the Chaudhary et al. (2015).\nThe waveform class is provided as waveform_class variable in the product. In addition, original\nwaveforms from the S-IGDR product as waveforms are also provided.\nNote: It is suggested to users should not use the very noisy (Class 3), peak with noise (Class\n8), Peak at the end (Class 4) and Linear (Class 6) because they have very high noise or\ntracker failures\n5. Geophysical Corrections\nThere are various geophysical corrections which need to be applied to the range measurements to\naccount for the signal delay. All these corrections are provided in the S-IGDR product as 1 Hz.\nThe same values have been interpolated at 40-Hz using cubic spline interpolation. No specific\nprocessing of the corrections in this version of coastal product has been done. However, for the\nsake of brevity, standard corrections provided in S-IGDR version for 1-Hz are listed below:\n1) Dry Tropospheric correction\nThis correction is due to the presence of the dry air medium between the satellite and the oceans\nwhich affects the velocity of propagation of the radio pulse. Its value is approx. -2.3 m and it\nvaries very less. European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) numerical\nweather prediction models are used to compute the surface pressure (Chelton et.al ,2001) and\nthen inverse barometer corrections. These values are provided in S-IGDR product. In the present\ncoastal product, the variable dry_tropo_model_interp_40hz represents the 40-Hz interpolated\ndry tropospheric corrections.\n2) Wet Tropospheric correction\nThis correction is due to the presence of water vapor and the liquid water. It is highly variable in\nthe atmosphere and many times the correction reaches up to 40 cm. It is corrected in the open\nocean by the use of onboard MWR at different frequencies. In the coastal areas, however, the\nradiometer itself is contaminated thus providing inaccurate corrections. Therefore, since the\npresent product is within 50 km, wet tropospheric corrections calculated from the ECMWF\n17\nmodel is used. These corrections are once again interpolated to 40-Hz. It is provided as wet-\ntropo_model_interp_40hz in the product.\n3) Tidal corrections\nThere are three types of contributions to the tidal effect:\na) Geocentric Ocean tide\nThis correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as\ngeoc_ocean_tide_sol1_interp_40hz. It is calculated from GOT 4.8 Ocean Tide Model Ray\n(1999)\nb) Solid Earth tide\nThis correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as\nsolid_earth_tide_interp_40hz. More details about this correction is provided in SARAL/AltiKa\nProduct Handbook (December, 2013).\nc) Pole tide\nThis correction is taken from the original S-IDGR data, interpolated at 40-Hz and is provided as\npole_tide_interp_40hz. It is calculated in IGDR as described in Wahr (1985). Users can refer\nSARAL/AltiKa Products Handbook (December, 2013) for details about these corrections.\n4) Sea state Bias corrections\nThis correction arises due to asymmetry of the reflecting properties of various scattering\nelements contributing for the average return. Troughs on the reflecting surface reflect better than\nthe crests which creates the bias of the measured heights towards the troughs. Also the\ninstrument measures the median rather than the mean scattering surface which creates an\nadditional error. The distribution of the reflecting elements on the surface is skewed rather than\nsymmetrical. This error is due to sea state and hence known as sea state bias. This is computed\nby empirical algorithms as described in Labroure (2004). This correction is provided as\nsea_state_bias_interp_40hz.\n18\n5) Ionospheric Corrections\nThis correction arises due to slowing down of group velocity of radar pulse by the presence of\nfree electrons in the ionosphere. Ionospheric correction in Ka band altimeter is one order less\nthan Ku band altimeters. Dual frequency ionospheric correction is not possible in\nSARAL/AltiKa due to the absence of additional altimeter frequency. Therefore, external data are\nused to compute ionospheric correction. Total Electron Content computed from GPS based\nobservations and ionosphere model (JPL GIM model) are used to account for this correction.\n6) Inverse Barometer Corrections\nThis correction corresponds to the change in sea level due to variations in atmospheric pressure\nvariations. Higher the pressure lower is the sea level. It is computed from the surface pressure\nvalues as provided by numerical prediction model (NWP) and dry tropospheric correction. In the\npresent version of the coastal product, it is provided as inv_barr_interp_40hz. This correction\ngiven for 1-Hz data in S-IGDR has been once again interpolated to 40-Hz data.\n7) High frequency fluctuation Corrections\nThis correction is ocean‚Äôs response to the wind and pressure and has energy at periods shorter\nthan 20 days. It is considered as the departure from the inverse barometers effect to pressure and\nadditionally wind effects. This correction is calculated by using specific models (SARAL/AltiKa\nProducts Handbook, 2013). These corrections are interpolated at 40-Hz and provided as\nhf_fluctuations_interp_40hz. More details about this correction are in Stammer et al. (1999)\nand Tierney et al. (2000).\n6. Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Bathymetry\nIn order to compute the SSHA, MSS is required. SARAL/AltiKa S-IGDR product provides MSS\nfrom MSS_CNES_CLS11 model which is computed from 16 years of satellite altimetry data. 1-\nHz MSS data has been interpolated to 40-Hz.\n19\nThere are two different geoid provided in the product. One is geoid_interp_40hz which is\ninterpolated at 40-Hz from the EGM96 geopotential model (Lemoine et al., (1998)) provided in\nthe S-IGDR data.\nAnother one is geoid_sac, which is a high resolution geoid in the Indian Ocean (Sreejith et al.,\n2013).\nBathymetry is provided in the product from Sindhu et al. (2007) which is made using Smith and\nSandwell, 2 minute bathymetry, ETOPO2v2, specifically corrected for the Indian Ocean region.\n7. Other parameters\nSome other parameters are also provided as listed below:\n1) Geolocation: The geolocation is provided as longitude_40hz, latitude_40hz\n2) Time: Time of the observation is provided as seconds since 2000-01-01 00:00:00.0. It is\nprovided as time_40hz\n3) Distance from the coast: This parameter is calculated from high resolution coastline created\nat Space Applications Centre (SAC). It is provided as distance_from_coast_40hz\n4) Land Flag: This flag is calculated from high resolution coastline created at SAC. It is\nprovided as land_flag_40hz.\nNote: It is suggested that users check the retracking quality flags, mqe threshold, distance\nfrom the coast, waveform class, trailing edge variation flag and valid parameter range for\nfiltering out bad data values.\n20\nAppendix A: List of Acronyms\nBAGP: Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak\nBAGP-NM: Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak ‚Äì Nelder Mead\nCNES: Centre National d‚ÄôEtudes Spatiales\nECMWF: European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting\nFFT: Fast Fourier Transform\nGDR: Geophysical Data Record\nI-GDR: Interim Geophysical Data Record\nISRO: Indian Space Research Organisation\nMSS: Mean Sea Surface\nMWR: Microwave Radiometer\nMLE: Maximum Likelihood Estimator\nMQE: Mean Quadratic Error\nNetCDF: Network Common Data Format\nNWP: Numerical Weather Prediction\nPOD: Precision Orbit Determination\nRMS: Root Mean Square\nSLA: Sea Level Anomaly\nSAC: Space Applications Centre\nS-IGDR: Sensor Interim Geophysical Data Record\nSSHA: Sea Surface Height Anomaly\nSSH: Sea Surface Height\nSWH: Significant Wave height\nSARAL: Satellite with ARgos and AltiKa\nTEC: Total Electron Content\n21\nAppendix B: References\nAmarouche L, Thibaut P, Zanife O.-Z, Dumont, P.
